Qwen3-Omni matches the performance of same-sized single-modal models within the Qwen series and excels particularly on audio tasks. Across 36 audio and audio-visual benchmarks, Qwen3-Omni achieves open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) on 32 benchmarks and overall SOTA on 22, outperforming strong closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro, Seed-ASR, and GPT-4o-Transcribe.\nQwen3-Omni adopts a Thinker&#8211;Talker Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that unifies perception and generation across text, images, audio, and video, yielding fluent text and natural real-time speech. It supports text interaction in 119 languages, speech understanding in 19 languages and speech generation in 10 languages. The system can process audio recordings up to 40 minutes per instance for ASR and spoken-language understanding, enabling high-quality audio and audiovisual experiences across locales. It demonstrates strong instruction following and allows fine-grained customization of conversational tone and persona via user-defined system prompts.\nTo reduce first-packet latency in streaming synthesis, the Talker autoregressively predicts discrete speech codecs using a multi-codebook scheme. Leveraging the representational capacity of these codebooks, we replace computationally intensive block-wise diffusion with a lightweight causal ConvNet, enabling streaming from the first codec frame. In cold-start settings (no prior context), Qwen3-Omni achieves a theoretical end-to-end first-packet latency of 234 ms.\nTo further strengthen multimodal reasoning, we introduce a Thinking model that explicitly reasons over inputs from any modality. Since the research community currently lacks a general-purpose audio captioning model, we fine-tuned Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B to obtain Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner, which produces detailed, low-hallucination captions for arbitrary audio inputs. Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B, Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking and Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner are publicly released under the Apache 2.0 license.</p>\n\n",

We demonstrate that joint multimodal training can achieve parity across all modalities&#8212;i.e., no modality-specific performance degradation&#8212;while markedly enhancing cross-modal capabilities such as video understanding. A key ingredient is mixing unimodal and cross-modal data during the early stage of text pretraining. As evidenced by Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Base, its text and vision performance is on par with same-sized single-modal text and vision base models across extensive benchmarks, while simultaneously exhibiting strong audio competence, audiovisual understanding, cross-modal &#8220;thinking&#8221;, and real-time audiovisual interaction. The development of non-degrading multimodal systems is an achievable objective. Such systems are characterized by two key properties: first, their ability to match the performance of specialized unimodal models in their respective tasks, and second, their capacity to facilitate novel cross-modal reasoning and interaction. These latter capabilities represent a significant advantage, as they are not present in traditional unimodal approaches.</p>\n\n",

During training, the filter bank features of the audio are downsampled 8 times using Conv2D blocks before the attention layers, reducing the token rate to 12.5 Hz. To learn stronger and more general-purpose audio representations, AuT is trained on large-scale audio datasets with both speech recognition and audio understanding tasks. Specifically, the training data includes 80% Chinese and English pseudo-labeled ASR data, 10% ASR data from other languages, and 10% audio understanding data. To balance the efficiency of real-time prefill caching with the performance for offline audio tasks, AuT utilizes flash attention with dynamic attention window sizes, covering attention query patterns ranging from 1 to 8 seconds.

TM-RoPE factorizes the conventional rotary position embedding into three distinct dimensions: temporal, height, and width. In the original M-RoPE formulation, temporal dependencies are modeled using the initial 16 rotary angles, which correspond to higher frequencies and exhibit stronger oscillatory patterns. While this design is effective for capturing fine-grained local temporal variations, it can impede the model&#8217;s ability to extrapolate over extended sequences. To address this limitation, we introduce a modified allocation of rotary angles. Specifically, the temporal, height, and width dimensions are interleaved and assigned 24, 20, and 20 rotary angles, respectively. This redistribution fosters a more balanced representation of both local semantics and long-range dependencies, thereby enhancing the model&#8217;s overall performance. The application of TM-RoPE is tailored to the specific modality of the input data. For text inputs, the three components share identical position identifiers, rendering TM-RoPE functionally equivalent to a one-dimensional RoPE <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep\">(Su et al., <a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2509.17765v1#bib.bib47\" title=\"\">2024</a>)</cite>. Similarly, audio inputs utilize shared position IDs but are further augmented with absolute temporal encodings, where each temporal ID corresponds to a duration of 80 ms. For image data, a constant temporal ID is assigned to all visual tokens, while their distinct row and column positions determine the height and width IDs.</p>\n\n",

The video is treated as a sequence of frames with monotonically increasing temporal IDs that are dynamically adjusted based on their actual timestamps to ensure a consistent temporal resolution of 80 ms per ID. The height and width IDs for video frames are assigned in the same manner as for still images. To prevent positional conflicts when processing multiple modalities, the position numbering is made contiguous, with each subsequent modality commencing from one plus the maximum position ID of the preceding modality. This refined approach to positional encoding enables the model to effectively integrate and jointly model information from diverse modalities. In a departure from Qwen2.5-Omni, which segments audiovisual representations into fixed 2-second chunks, Qwen3-Omni directly aligns these representations using their temporal IDs, which are explicitly anchored to absolute time. This design choice affords the model the flexibility to support streaming inputs of arbitrary duration.</p>\n\n",

This strategy enables the model to learn a complete representation of acoustic details, enhancing vocal expressivity. Consequently, waveform reconstruction is simplified to a lightweight causal ConvNet (Code2Wav), which significantly reduces inference latency and computational cost (FLOPs) while achieving superior audio fidelity compared to more complex DiT-based vocoders.</p>\n\n",

Several factors influence the total first-packet latency. First, the model sizes of Thinker and Talker impact their tail packet preprocessing latency (multi-modal data preprocessing and inference for Audio and Vision Encoder) and Time-To-First-Token (TTPT). Second, the architectures and sizes of the MTP Module and Codec Decoder affect their inference latency. Due to the sequential dependency between these components, the total first-packet latency represents the sum of these individual latencies. As shown in the results, the MoE architecture of Thinker and Talker ensures that their prefill latency and TTPT remain largely unaffected under high concurrency. Meanwhile, the lightweight design of the MTP Module and Codec Decoder minimizes their computational overhead, resulting in a lower impact on first-packet latency. Furthermore, after the initial packet is output and the model starts streaming audio synthesis, the 12.5Hz token rate Talker requires only one token to synthesize 80ms audio. Consequently, the Generation Real Time Factor (RTF) is calculated by dividing the sum of: (1) the time taken by Thinker and Talker to generate one token; and (2) the processing time per token for the MTP Module and Codec Decoder by 80ms. As demonstrated, the RTF consistently remains below 1 across varying concurrency levels, ensuring that users receive continuously streaming audio responses.</p>\n\n",

Several factors influence the total first-packet latency. First, the model sizes of Thinker and Talker impact their tail packet preprocessing latency (multi-modal data preprocessing and inference for Audio and Vision Encoder) and Time-To-First-Token (TTPT). Second, the architectures and sizes of the MTP Module and Codec Decoder affect their inference latency. Due to the sequential dependency between these components, the total first-packet latency represents the sum of these individual latencies. As shown in the results, the MoE architecture of Thinker and Talker ensures that their prefill latency and TTPT remain largely unaffected under high concurrency. Meanwhile, the lightweight design of the MTP Module and Codec Decoder minimizes their computational overhead, resulting in a lower impact on first-packet latency. Furthermore, after the initial packet is output and the model starts streaming audio synthesis, the 12.5Hz token rate Talker requires only one token to synthesize 80ms audio. Consequently, the Generation Real Time Factor (RTF) is calculated by dividing the sum of: (1) the time taken by Thinker and Talker to generate one token; and (2) the processing time per token for the MTP Module and Codec Decoder by 80ms. As demonstrated, the RTF consistently remains below 1 across varying concurrency levels, ensuring that users receive continuously streaming audio responses.</p>\n\n"

Qwen3-Omni matches the performance of same-sized single-modal models within the Qwen series and excels particularly on audio tasks. Across 36 audio and audio-visual benchmarks, Qwen3-Omni achieves open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) on 32 benchmarks and overall SOTA on 22, outperforming strong closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro, Seed-ASR, and GPT-4o-Transcribe.\nQwen3-Omni adopts a Thinker&#8211;Talker Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that unifies perception and generation across text, images, audio, and video, yielding fluent text and natural real-time speech. It supports text interaction in 119 languages, speech understanding in 19 languages and speech generation in 10 languages. The system can process audio recordings up to 40 minutes per instance for ASR and spoken-language understanding, enabling high-quality audio and audiovisual experiences across locales. It demonstrates strong instruction following and allows fine-grained customization of conversational tone and persona via user-defined system prompts.\nTo reduce first-packet latency in streaming synthesis, the Talker autoregressively predicts discrete speech codecs using a multi-codebook scheme. Leveraging the representational capacity of these codebooks, we replace computationally intensive block-wise diffusion with a lightweight causal ConvNet, enabling streaming from the first codec frame. In cold-start settings (no prior context), Qwen3-Omni achieves a theoretical end-to-end first-packet latency of 234 ms.\nTo further strengthen multimodal reasoning, we introduce a Thinking model that explicitly reasons over inputs from any modality. Since the research community currently lacks a general-purpose audio captioning model, we fine-tuned Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B to obtain Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner, which produces detailed, low-hallucination captions for arbitrary audio inputs. Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B, Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking and Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner are publicly released under the Apache 2.0 license.</p>\n\n",

Specifically, the training data includes 80% Chinese and English pseudo-labeled ASR data, 10% ASR data from other languages, and 10% audio understanding data.

The video is treated as a sequence of frames with monotonically increasing temporal IDs that are dynamically adjusted based on their actual timestamps to ensure a consistent temporal resolution of 80 ms per ID. The height and width IDs for video frames are assigned in the same manner as for still images. To prevent positional conflicts when processing multiple modalities, the position numbering is made contiguous, with each subsequent modality commencing from one plus the maximum position ID of the preceding modality. This refined approach to positional encoding enables the model to effectively integrate and jointly model information from diverse modalities. In a departure from Qwen2.5-Omni, which segments audiovisual representations into fixed 2-second chunks, Qwen3-Omni directly aligns these representations using their temporal IDs, which are explicitly anchored to absolute time. This design choice affords the model the flexibility to support streaming inputs of arbitrary duration.</p>\n\n",

This strategy enables the model to learn a complete representation of acoustic details, enhancing vocal expressivity.

Qwen3-Omni matches the performance of same-sized single-modal models within the Qwen series and excels particularly on audio tasks. Across 36 audio and audio-visual benchmarks, Qwen3-Omni achieves open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) on 32 benchmarks and overall SOTA on 22, outperforming strong closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro, Seed-ASR, and GPT-4o-Transcribe.\nQwen3-Omni adopts a Thinker&#8211;Talker Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that unifies perception and generation across text, images, audio, and video, yielding fluent text and natural real-time speech. It supports text interaction in 119 languages, speech understanding in 19 languages and speech generation in 10 languages. The system can process audio recordings up to 40 minutes per instance for ASR and spoken-language understanding, enabling high-quality audio and audiovisual experiences across locales. It demonstrates strong instruction following and allows fine-grained customization of conversational tone and persona via user-defined system prompts.\nTo reduce first-packet latency in streaming synthesis, the Talker autoregressively predicts discrete speech codecs using a multi-codebook scheme. Leveraging the representational capacity of these codebooks, we replace computationally intensive block-wise diffusion with a lightweight causal ConvNet, enabling streaming from the first codec frame. In cold-start settings (no prior context), Qwen3-Omni achieves a theoretical end-to-end first-packet latency of 234 ms.\nTo further strengthen multimodal reasoning, we introduce a Thinking model that explicitly reasons over inputs from any modality. Since the research community currently lacks a general-purpose audio captioning model, we fine-tuned Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B to obtain Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner, which produces detailed, low-hallucination captions for arbitrary audio inputs. Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B, Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking and Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner are publicly released under the Apache 2.0 license.</p>\n\n",

TM-RoPE factorizes the conventional rotary position embedding into three distinct dimensions: temporal, height, and width. In the original M-RoPE formulation, temporal dependencies are modeled using the initial 16 rotary angles, which correspond to higher frequencies and exhibit stronger oscillatory patterns. While this design is effective for capturing fine-grained local temporal variations, it can impede the model&#8217;s ability to extrapolate over extended sequences. To address this limitation, we introduce a modified allocation of rotary angles. Specifically, the temporal, height, and width dimensions are interleaved and assigned 24, 20, and 20 rotary angles, respectively. This redistribution fosters a more balanced representation of both local semantics and long-range dependencies, thereby enhancing the model&#8217;s overall performance. The application of TM-RoPE is tailored to the specific modality of the input data. For text inputs, the three components share identical position identifiers, rendering TM-RoPE functionally equivalent to a one-dimensional RoPE <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep\">(Su et al., <a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2509.17765v1#bib.bib47\" title=\"\">2024</a>)</cite>. Similarly, audio inputs utilize shared position IDs but are further augmented with absolute temporal encodings, where each temporal ID corresponds to a duration of 80 ms. For image data, a constant temporal ID is assigned to all visual tokens, while their distinct row and column positions determine the height and width IDs.</p>\n\n",

The video is treated as a sequence of frames with monotonically increasing temporal IDs that are dynamically adjusted based on their actual timestamps to ensure a consistent temporal resolution of 80 ms per ID. The height and width IDs for video frames are assigned in the same manner as for still images. To prevent positional conflicts when processing multiple modalities, the position numbering is made contiguous, with each subsequent modality commencing from one plus the maximum position ID of the preceding modality. This refined approach to positional encoding enables the model to effectively integrate and jointly model information from diverse modalities. In a departure from Qwen2.5-Omni, which segments audiovisual representations into fixed 2-second chunks, Qwen3-Omni directly aligns these representations using their temporal IDs, which are explicitly anchored to absolute time. This design choice affords the model the flexibility to support streaming inputs of arbitrary duration.</p>\n\n",

Qwen3-Omni matches the performance of same-sized single-modal models within the Qwen series and excels particularly on audio tasks. Across 36 audio and audio-visual benchmarks, Qwen3-Omni achieves open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) on 32 benchmarks and overall SOTA on 22, outperforming strong closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro, Seed-ASR, and GPT-4o-Transcribe.\nQwen3-Omni adopts a Thinker&#8211;Talker Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that unifies perception and generation across text, images, audio, and video, yielding fluent text and natural real-time speech. It supports text interaction in 119 languages, speech understanding in 19 languages and speech generation in 10 languages. The system can process audio recordings up to 40 minutes per instance for ASR and spoken-language understanding, enabling high-quality audio and audiovisual experiences across locales. It demonstrates strong instruction following and allows fine-grained customization of conversational tone and persona via user-defined system prompts.\nTo reduce first-packet latency in streaming synthesis, the Talker autoregressively predicts discrete speech codecs using a multi-codebook scheme. Leveraging the representational capacity of these codebooks, we replace computationally intensive block-wise diffusion with a lightweight causal ConvNet, enabling streaming from the first codec frame. In cold-start settings (no prior context), Qwen3-Omni achieves a theoretical end-to-end first-packet latency of 234 ms.\nTo further strengthen multimodal reasoning, we introduce a Thinking model that explicitly reasons over inputs from any modality. Since the research community currently lacks a general-purpose audio captioning model, we fine-tuned Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B to obtain Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner, which produces detailed, low-hallucination captions for arbitrary audio inputs. Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B, Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking and Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner are publicly released under the Apache 2.0 license.</p>\n\n",

We demonstrate that joint multimodal training can achieve parity across all modalities&#8212;i.e., no modality-specific performance degradation&#8212;while markedly enhancing cross-modal capabilities such as video understanding. A key ingredient is mixing unimodal and cross-modal data during the early stage of text pretraining. As evidenced by Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Base, its text and vision performance is on par with same-sized single-modal text and vision base models across extensive benchmarks, while simultaneously exhibiting strong audio competence, audiovisual understanding, cross-modal &#8220;thinking&#8221;, and real-time audiovisual interaction. The development of non-degrading multimodal systems is an achievable objective. Such systems are characterized by two key properties: first, their ability to match the performance of specialized unimodal models in their respective tasks, and second, their capacity to facilitate novel cross-modal reasoning and interaction. These latter capabilities represent a significant advantage, as they are not present in traditional unimodal approaches.</p>\n\n",

During training, the filter bank features of the audio are downsampled 8 times using Conv2D blocks before the attention layers, reducing the token rate to 12.5 Hz. To learn stronger and more general-purpose audio representations, AuT is trained on large-scale audio datasets with both speech recognition and audio understanding tasks. Specifically, the training data includes 80% Chinese and English pseudo-labeled ASR data, 10% ASR data from other languages, and 10% audio understanding data. To balance the efficiency of real-time prefill caching with the performance for offline audio tasks, AuT utilizes flash attention with dynamic attention window sizes, covering attention query patterns ranging from 1 to 8 seconds. In Qwen3-Omni, we employ the AuT encoder as the audio encoder, which contains approximately 0.6B parameters.</p>\n\n",

TM-RoPE factorizes the conventional rotary position embedding into three distinct dimensions: temporal, height, and width. In the original M-RoPE formulation, temporal dependencies are modeled using the initial 16 rotary angles, which correspond to higher frequencies and exhibit stronger oscillatory patterns. While this design is effective for capturing fine-grained local temporal variations, it can impede the model&#8217;s ability to extrapolate over extended sequences. To address this limitation, we introduce a modified allocation of rotary angles. Specifically, the temporal, height, and width dimensions are interleaved and assigned 24, 20, and 20 rotary angles, respectively. This redistribution fosters a more balanced representation of both local semantics and long-range dependencies, thereby enhancing the model&#8217;s overall performance. The application of TM-RoPE is tailored to the specific modality of the input data. For text inputs, the three components share identical position identifiers, rendering TM-RoPE functionally equivalent to a one-dimensional RoPE <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep\">(Su et al., <a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2509.17765v1#bib.bib47\" title=\"\">2024</a>)</cite>. Similarly, audio inputs utilize shared position IDs but are further augmented with absolute temporal encodings, where each temporal ID corresponds to a duration of 80 ms. For image data, a constant temporal ID is assigned to all visual tokens, while their distinct row and column positions determine the height and width IDs.</p>\n\n",

Qwen3-Omni matches the performance of same-sized single-modal models within the Qwen series and excels particularly on audio tasks. Across 36 audio and audio-visual benchmarks, Qwen3-Omni achieves open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) on 32 benchmarks and overall SOTA on 22, outperforming strong closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro, Seed-ASR, and GPT-4o-Transcribe.\nQwen3-Omni adopts a Thinker&#8211;Talker Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that unifies perception and generation across text, images, audio, and video, yielding fluent text and natural real-time speech. It supports text interaction in 119 languages, speech understanding in 19 languages and speech generation in 10 languages. The system can process audio recordings up to 40 minutes per instance for ASR and spoken-language understanding, enabling high-quality audio and audiovisual experiences across locales. It demonstrates strong instruction following and allows fine-grained customization of conversational tone and persona via user-defined system prompts.\nTo reduce first-packet latency in streaming synthesis, the Talker autoregressively predicts discrete speech codecs using a multi-codebook scheme. Leveraging the representational capacity of these codebooks, we replace computationally intensive block-wise diffusion with a lightweight causal ConvNet, enabling streaming from the first codec frame. In cold-start settings (no prior context), Qwen3-Omni achieves a theoretical end-to-end first-packet latency of 234 ms.\nTo further strengthen multimodal reasoning, we introduce a Thinking model that explicitly reasons over inputs from any modality. Since the research community currently lacks a general-purpose audio captioning model, we fine-tuned Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B to obtain Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner, which produces detailed, low-hallucination captions for arbitrary audio inputs.

We demonstrate that joint multimodal training can achieve parity across all modalities&#8212;i.e., no modality-specific performance degradation&#8212;while markedly enhancing cross-modal capabilities such as video understanding. A key ingredient is mixing unimodal and cross-modal data during the early stage of text pretraining. As evidenced by Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Base, its text and vision performance is on par with same-sized single-modal text and vision base models across extensive benchmarks, while simultaneously exhibiting strong audio competence, audiovisual understanding, cross-modal &#8220;thinking&#8221;, and real-time audiovisual interaction. The development of non-degrading multimodal systems is an achievable objective. Such systems are characterized by two key properties: first, their ability to match the performance of specialized unimodal models in their respective tasks, and second, their capacity to facilitate novel cross-modal reasoning and interaction. These latter capabilities represent a significant advantage, as they are not present in traditional unimodal approaches.</p>\n\n",

During training, the filter bank features of the audio are downsampled 8 times using Conv2D blocks before the attention layers, reducing the token rate to 12.5 Hz. To learn stronger and more general-purpose audio representations, AuT is trained on large-scale audio datasets with both speech recognition and audio understanding tasks. Specifically, the training data includes 80% Chinese and English pseudo-labeled ASR data, 10% ASR data from other languages, and 10% audio understanding data. To balance the efficiency of real-time prefill caching with the performance for offline audio tasks, AuT utilizes flash attention with dynamic attention window sizes, covering attention query patterns ranging from 1 to 8 seconds.

TM-RoPE factorizes the conventional rotary position embedding into three distinct dimensions: temporal, height, and width. In the original M-RoPE formulation, temporal dependencies are modeled using the initial 16 rotary angles, which correspond to higher frequencies and exhibit stronger oscillatory patterns. While this design is effective for capturing fine-grained local temporal variations, it can impede the model&#8217;s ability to extrapolate over extended sequences. To address this limitation, we introduce a modified allocation of rotary angles. Specifically, the temporal, height, and width dimensions are interleaved and assigned 24, 20, and 20 rotary angles, respectively. This redistribution fosters a more balanced representation of both local semantics and long-range dependencies, thereby enhancing the model&#8217;s overall performance. The application of TM-RoPE is tailored to the specific modality of the input data. For text inputs, the three components share identical position identifiers, rendering TM-RoPE functionally equivalent to a one-dimensional RoPE <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep\">(Su et al., <a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2509.17765v1#bib.bib47\" title=\"\">2024</a>)</cite>. Similarly, audio inputs utilize shared position IDs but are further augmented with absolute temporal encodings, where each temporal ID corresponds to a duration of 80 ms. For image data, a constant temporal ID is assigned to all visual tokens, while their distinct row and column positions determine the height and width IDs.</p>\n\n",

Qwen3-Omni matches the performance of same-sized single-modal models within the Qwen series and excels particularly on audio tasks. Across 36 audio and audio-visual benchmarks, Qwen3-Omni achieves open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) on 32 benchmarks and overall SOTA on 22, outperforming strong closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro, Seed-ASR, and GPT-4o-Transcribe.\nQwen3-Omni adopts a Thinker&#8211;Talker Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that unifies perception and generation across text, images, audio, and video, yielding fluent text and natural real-time speech. It supports text interaction in 119 languages, speech understanding in 19 languages and speech generation in 10 languages. The system can process audio recordings up to 40 minutes per instance for ASR and spoken-language understanding, enabling high-quality audio and audiovisual experiences across locales. It demonstrates strong instruction following and allows fine-grained customization of conversational tone and persona via user-defined system prompts.\nTo reduce first-packet latency in streaming synthesis, the Talker autoregressively predicts discrete speech codecs using a multi-codebook scheme. Leveraging the representational capacity of these codebooks, we replace computationally intensive block-wise diffusion with a lightweight causal ConvNet, enabling streaming from the first codec frame. In cold-start settings (no prior context), Qwen3-Omni achieves a theoretical end-to-end first-packet latency of 234 ms.\nTo further strengthen multimodal reasoning, we introduce a Thinking model that explicitly reasons over inputs from any modality. Since the research community currently lacks a general-purpose audio captioning model, we fine-tuned Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B to obtain Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner, which produces detailed, low-hallucination captions for arbitrary audio inputs. Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B, Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking and Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner are publicly released under the Apache 2.0 license.</p>\n\n",

We demonstrate that joint multimodal training can achieve parity across all modalities&#8212;i.e., no modality-specific performance degradation&#8212;while markedly enhancing cross-modal capabilities such as video understanding. A key ingredient is mixing unimodal and cross-modal data during the early stage of text pretraining. As evidenced by Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Base, its text and vision performance is on par with same-sized single-modal text and vision base models across extensive benchmarks, while simultaneously exhibiting strong audio competence, audiovisual understanding, cross-modal &#8220;thinking&#8221;, and real-time audiovisual interaction. The development of non-degrading multimodal systems is an achievable objective. Such systems are characterized by two key properties: first, their ability to match the performance of specialized unimodal models in their respective tasks, and second, their capacity to facilitate novel cross-modal reasoning and interaction. These latter capabilities represent a significant advantage, as they are not present in traditional unimodal approaches.</p>\n\n",

During training, the filter bank features of the audio are downsampled 8 times using Conv2D blocks before the attention layers, reducing the token rate to 12.5 Hz. To learn stronger and more general-purpose audio representations, AuT is trained on large-scale audio datasets with both speech recognition and audio understanding tasks. Specifically, the training data includes 80% Chinese and English pseudo-labeled ASR data, 10% ASR data from other languages, and 10% audio understanding data. To balance the efficiency of real-time prefill caching with the performance for offline audio tasks, AuT utilizes flash attention with dynamic attention window sizes, covering attention query patterns ranging from 1 to 8 seconds.

Qwen3-Omni matches the performance of same-sized single-modal models within the Qwen series and excels particularly on audio tasks. Across 36 audio and audio-visual benchmarks, Qwen3-Omni achieves open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) on 32 benchmarks and overall SOTA on 22, outperforming strong closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro, Seed-ASR, and GPT-4o-Transcribe.\nQwen3-Omni adopts a Thinker&#8211;Talker Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that unifies perception and generation across text, images, audio, and video, yielding fluent text and natural real-time speech. It supports text interaction in 119 languages, speech understanding in 19 languages and speech generation in 10 languages. The system can process audio recordings up to 40 minutes per instance for ASR and spoken-language understanding, enabling high-quality audio and audiovisual experiences across locales. It demonstrates strong instruction following and allows fine-grained customization of conversational tone and persona via user-defined system prompts.\nTo reduce first-packet latency in streaming synthesis, the Talker autoregressively predicts discrete speech codecs using a multi-codebook scheme. Leveraging the representational capacity of these codebooks, we replace computationally intensive block-wise diffusion with a lightweight causal ConvNet, enabling streaming from the first codec frame. In cold-start settings (no prior context), Qwen3-Omni achieves a theoretical end-to-end first-packet latency of 234 ms.\nTo further strengthen multimodal reasoning, we introduce a Thinking model that explicitly reasons over inputs from any modality. Since the research community currently lacks a general-purpose audio captioning model, we fine-tuned Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B to obtain Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner, which produces detailed, low-hallucination captions for arbitrary audio inputs.

We demonstrate that joint multimodal training can achieve parity across all modalities&#8212;i.e., no modality-specific performance degradation&#8212;while markedly enhancing cross-modal capabilities such as video understanding. A key ingredient is mixing unimodal and cross-modal data during the early stage of text pretraining. As evidenced by Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Base, its text and vision performance is on par with same-sized single-modal text and vision base models across extensive benchmarks, while simultaneously exhibiting strong audio competence, audiovisual understanding, cross-modal &#8220;thinking&#8221;, and real-time audiovisual interaction. The development of non-degrading multimodal systems is an achievable objective. Such systems are characterized by two key properties: first, their ability to match the performance of specialized unimodal models in their respective tasks, and second, their capacity to facilitate novel cross-modal reasoning and interaction. These latter capabilities represent a significant advantage, as they are not present in traditional unimodal approaches.</p>\n\n",

To learn stronger and more general-purpose audio representations, AuT is trained on large-scale audio datasets with both speech recognition and audio understanding tasks. Specifically, the training data includes 80% Chinese and English pseudo-labeled ASR data, 10% ASR data from other languages, and 10% audio understanding data. To balance the efficiency of real-time prefill caching with the performance for offline audio tasks, AuT utilizes flash attention with dynamic attention window sizes, covering attention query patterns ranging from 1 to 8 seconds.

                "html": "<p class=\"ltx_p\">Drawing inspiration from Qwen2.5-Omni, we employs a Time-aligned Multimodal Rotary Position Embedding (TM-RoPE), which extends the Multimodal Rotary Position Embedding (M-RoPE) <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep\">(Bai et al., <a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2509.17765v1#bib.bib8\" title=\"\">2023b</a>)</cite> by incorporating absolute temporal information. TM-RoPE factorizes the conventional rotary position embedding into three distinct dimensions: temporal, height, and width. In the original M-RoPE formulation, temporal dependencies are modeled using the initial 16 rotary angles, which correspond to higher frequencies and exhibit stronger oscillatory patterns. While this design is effective for capturing fine-grained local temporal variations, it can impede the model&#8217;s ability to extrapolate over extended sequences. To address this limitation, we introduce a modified allocation of rotary angles. Specifically, the temporal, height, and width dimensions are interleaved and assigned 24, 20, and 20 rotary angles, respectively. This redistribution fosters a more balanced representation of both local semantics and long-range dependencies, thereby enhancing the model&#8217;s overall performance. The application of TM-RoPE is tailored to the specific modality of the input data. For text inputs, the three components share identical position identifiers, rendering TM-RoPE functionally equivalent to a one-dimensional RoPE <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep\">(Su et al., <a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2509.17765v1#bib.bib47\" title=\"\">2024</a>)</cite>. Similarly, audio inputs utilize shared position IDs but are further augmented with absolute temporal encodings, where each temporal ID corresponds to a duration of 80 ms. For image data, a constant temporal ID is assigned to all visual tokens, while their distinct row and column positions determine the height and width IDs.</p>\n\n",

The video is treated as a sequence of frames with monotonically increasing temporal IDs that are dynamically adjusted based on their actual timestamps to ensure a consistent temporal resolution of 80 ms per ID. The height and width IDs for video frames are assigned in the same manner as for still images. To prevent positional conflicts when processing multiple modalities, the position numbering is made contiguous, with each subsequent modality commencing from one plus the maximum position ID of the preceding modality. This refined approach to positional encoding enables the model to effectively integrate and jointly model information from diverse modalities. In a departure from Qwen2.5-Omni, which segments audiovisual representations into fixed 2-second chunks, Qwen3-Omni directly aligns these representations using their temporal IDs, which are explicitly anchored to absolute time. This design choice affords the model the flexibility to support streaming inputs of arbitrary duration.</p>\n\n",

This approach significantly reduces the Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) for both the Thinker and the Talker. Architecturally, both Thinker and the Talker in Qwen3-Omni adopt the MoE design, which is highly effective for improving service throughput. Compared to dense models, the MoE architecture significantly decreases IO consumption arising from KV cache during processing of long sequences, thereby increasing tokens per second (TPS) during generation and enhancing concurrency.</p>\n\n",

Several factors influence the total first-packet latency. First, the model sizes of Thinker and Talker impact their tail packet preprocessing latency (multi-modal data preprocessing and inference for Audio and Vision Encoder) and Time-To-First-Token (TTPT). Second, the architectures and sizes of the MTP Module and Codec Decoder affect their inference latency. Due to the sequential dependency between these components, the total first-packet latency represents the sum of these individual latencies. As shown in the results, the MoE architecture of Thinker and Talker ensures that their prefill latency and TTPT remain largely unaffected under high concurrency. Meanwhile, the lightweight design of the MTP Module and Codec Decoder minimizes their computational overhead, resulting in a lower impact on first-packet latency. Furthermore, after the initial packet is output and the model starts streaming audio synthesis, the 12.5Hz token rate Talker requires only one token to synthesize 80ms audio. Consequently, the Generation Real Time Factor (RTF) is calculated by dividing the sum of: (1) the time taken by Thinker and Talker to generate one token; and (2) the processing time per token for the MTP Module and Codec Decoder by 80ms. As demonstrated, the RTF consistently remains below 1 across varying concurrency levels, ensuring that users receive continuously streaming audio responses.</p>\n\n",

Qwen3-Omni matches the performance of same-sized single-modal models within the Qwen series and excels particularly on audio tasks. Across 36 audio and audio-visual benchmarks, Qwen3-Omni achieves open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) on 32 benchmarks and overall SOTA on 22, outperforming strong closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro, Seed-ASR, and GPT-4o-Transcribe.\nQwen3-Omni adopts a Thinker&#8211;Talker Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that unifies perception and generation across text, images, audio, and video, yielding fluent text and natural real-time speech. It supports text interaction in 119 languages, speech understanding in 19 languages and speech generation in 10 languages. The system can process audio recordings up to 40 minutes per instance for ASR and spoken-language understanding, enabling high-quality audio and audiovisual experiences across locales. It demonstrates strong instruction following and allows fine-grained customization of conversational tone and persona via user-defined system prompts.\nTo reduce first-packet latency in streaming synthesis, the Talker autoregressively predicts discrete speech codecs using a multi-codebook scheme. Leveraging the representational capacity of these codebooks, we replace computationally intensive block-wise diffusion with a lightweight causal ConvNet, enabling streaming from the first codec frame. In cold-start settings (no prior context), Qwen3-Omni achieves a theoretical end-to-end first-packet latency of 234 ms.\nTo further strengthen multimodal reasoning, we introduce a Thinking model that explicitly reasons over inputs from any modality. Since the research community currently lacks a general-purpose audio captioning model, we fine-tuned Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B to obtain Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner, which produces detailed, low-hallucination captions for arbitrary audio inputs.

We demonstrate that joint multimodal training can achieve parity across all modalities&#8212;i.e., no modality-specific performance degradation&#8212;while markedly enhancing cross-modal capabilities such as video understanding. A key ingredient is mixing unimodal and cross-modal data during the early stage of text pretraining. As evidenced by Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Base, its text and vision performance is on par with same-sized single-modal text and vision base models across extensive benchmarks, while simultaneously exhibiting strong audio competence, audiovisual understanding, cross-modal &#8220;thinking&#8221;, and real-time audiovisual interaction. The development of non-degrading multimodal systems is an achievable objective. Such systems are characterized by two key properties: first, their ability to match the performance of specialized unimodal models in their respective tasks, and second, their capacity to facilitate novel cross-modal reasoning and interaction. These latter capabilities represent a significant advantage, as they are not present in traditional unimodal approaches.</p>\n\n",

During training, the filter bank features of the audio are downsampled 8 times using Conv2D blocks before the attention layers, reducing the token rate to 12.5 Hz. To learn stronger and more general-purpose audio representations, AuT is trained on large-scale audio datasets with both speech recognition and audio understanding tasks. Specifically, the training data includes 80% Chinese and English pseudo-labeled ASR data, 10% ASR data from other languages, and 10% audio understanding data. To balance the efficiency of real-time prefill caching with the performance for offline audio tasks, AuT utilizes flash attention with dynamic attention window sizes, covering attention query patterns ranging from 1 to 8 seconds.

Qwen3-Omni matches the performance of same-sized single-modal models within the Qwen series and excels particularly on audio tasks. Across 36 audio and audio-visual benchmarks, Qwen3-Omni achieves open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) on 32 benchmarks and overall SOTA on 22, outperforming strong closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro, Seed-ASR, and GPT-4o-Transcribe.\nQwen3-Omni adopts a Thinker&#8211;Talker Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that unifies perception and generation across text, images, audio, and video, yielding fluent text and natural real-time speech. It supports text interaction in 119 languages, speech understanding in 19 languages and speech generation in 10 languages. The system can process audio recordings up to 40 minutes per instance for ASR and spoken-language understanding, enabling high-quality audio and audiovisual experiences across locales. It demonstrates strong instruction following and allows fine-grained customization of conversational tone and persona via user-defined system prompts.\nTo reduce first-packet latency in streaming synthesis, the Talker autoregressively predicts discrete speech codecs using a multi-codebook scheme. Leveraging the representational capacity of these codebooks, we replace computationally intensive block-wise diffusion with a lightweight causal ConvNet, enabling streaming from the first codec frame. In cold-start settings (no prior context), Qwen3-Omni achieves a theoretical end-to-end first-packet latency of 234 ms.\nTo further strengthen multimodal reasoning, we introduce a Thinking model that explicitly reasons over inputs from any modality. Since the research community currently lacks a general-purpose audio captioning model, we fine-tuned Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B to obtain Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner, which produces detailed, low-hallucination captions for arbitrary audio inputs.

We demonstrate that joint multimodal training can achieve parity across all modalities&#8212;i.e., no modality-specific performance degradation&#8212;while markedly enhancing cross-modal capabilities such as video understanding. A key ingredient is mixing unimodal and cross-modal data during the early stage of text pretraining.

The development of non-degrading multimodal systems is an achievable objective. Such systems are characterized by two key properties: first, their ability to match the performance of specialized unimodal models in their respective tasks, and second, their capacity to facilitate novel cross-modal reasoning and interaction. These latter capabilities represent a significant advantage, as they are not present in traditional unimodal approaches.</p>\n\n",

Specifically, the training data includes 80% Chinese and English pseudo-labeled ASR data, 10% ASR data from other languages, and 10% audio understanding data. To balance the efficiency of real-time prefill caching with the performance for offline audio tasks, AuT utilizes flash attention with dynamic attention window sizes, covering attention query patterns ranging from 1 to 8 seconds.

TM-RoPE factorizes the conventional rotary position embedding into three distinct dimensions: temporal, height, and width. In the original M-RoPE formulation, temporal dependencies are modeled using the initial 16 rotary angles, which correspond to higher frequencies and exhibit stronger oscillatory patterns. While this design is effective for capturing fine-grained local temporal variations, it can impede the model&#8217;s ability to extrapolate over extended sequences. To address this limitation, we introduce a modified allocation of rotary angles. Specifically, the temporal, height, and width dimensions are interleaved and assigned 24, 20, and 20 rotary angles, respectively. This redistribution fosters a more balanced representation of both local semantics and long-range dependencies, thereby enhancing the model&#8217;s overall performance. The application of TM-RoPE is tailored to the specific modality of the input data. For text inputs, the three components share identical position identifiers, rendering TM-RoPE functionally equivalent to a one-dimensional RoPE <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep\">(Su et al., <a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2509.17765v1#bib.bib47\" title=\"\">2024</a>)</cite>. Similarly, audio inputs utilize shared position IDs but are further augmented with absolute temporal encodings, where each temporal ID corresponds to a duration of 80 ms. For image data, a constant temporal ID is assigned to all visual tokens, while their distinct row and column positions determine the height and width IDs.</p>\n\n",

Qwen3-Omni matches the performance of same-sized single-modal models within the Qwen series and excels particularly on audio tasks. Across 36 audio and audio-visual benchmarks, Qwen3-Omni achieves open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) on 32 benchmarks and overall SOTA on 22, outperforming strong closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro, Seed-ASR, and GPT-4o-Transcribe.\nQwen3-Omni adopts a Thinker&#8211;Talker Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that unifies perception and generation across text, images, audio, and video, yielding fluent text and natural real-time speech. It supports text interaction in 119 languages, speech understanding in 19 languages and speech generation in 10 languages. The system can process audio recordings up to 40 minutes per instance for ASR and spoken-language understanding, enabling high-quality audio and audiovisual experiences across locales. It demonstrates strong instruction following and allows fine-grained customization of conversational tone and persona via user-defined system prompts.\nTo reduce first-packet latency in streaming synthesis, the Talker autoregressively predicts discrete speech codecs using a multi-codebook scheme. Leveraging the representational capacity of these codebooks, we replace computationally intensive block-wise diffusion with a lightweight causal ConvNet, enabling streaming from the first codec frame. In cold-start settings (no prior context), Qwen3-Omni achieves a theoretical end-to-end first-packet latency of 234 ms.\nTo further strengthen multimodal reasoning, we introduce a Thinking model that explicitly reasons over inputs from any modality. Since the research community currently lacks a general-purpose audio captioning model, we fine-tuned Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B to obtain Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner, which produces detailed, low-hallucination captions for arbitrary audio inputs. Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B, Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking and Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner are publicly released under the Apache 2.0 license.</p>\n\n",

We demonstrate that joint multimodal training can achieve parity across all modalities&#8212;i.e., no modality-specific performance degradation&#8212;while markedly enhancing cross-modal capabilities such as video understanding. A key ingredient is mixing unimodal and cross-modal data during the early stage of text pretraining. As evidenced by Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Base, its text and vision performance is on par with same-sized single-modal text and vision base models across extensive benchmarks, while simultaneously exhibiting strong audio competence, audiovisual understanding, cross-modal &#8220;thinking&#8221;, and real-time audiovisual interaction. The development of non-degrading multimodal systems is an achievable objective. Such systems are characterized by two key properties: first, their ability to match the performance of specialized unimodal models in their respective tasks, and second, their capacity to facilitate novel cross-modal reasoning and interaction. These latter capabilities represent a significant advantage, as they are not present in traditional unimodal approaches.</p>\n\n",

To learn stronger and more general-purpose audio representations, AuT is trained on large-scale audio datasets with both speech recognition and audio understanding tasks. Specifically, the training data includes 80% Chinese and English pseudo-labeled ASR data, 10% ASR data from other languages, and 10% audio understanding data. To balance the efficiency of real-time prefill caching with the performance for offline audio tasks, AuT utilizes flash attention with dynamic attention window sizes, covering attention query patterns ranging from 1 to 8 seconds.

TM-RoPE factorizes the conventional rotary position embedding into three distinct dimensions: temporal, height, and width. In the original M-RoPE formulation, temporal dependencies are modeled using the initial 16 rotary angles, which correspond to higher frequencies and exhibit stronger oscillatory patterns. While this design is effective for capturing fine-grained local temporal variations, it can impede the model&#8217;s ability to extrapolate over extended sequences. To address this limitation, we introduce a modified allocation of rotary angles. Specifically, the temporal, height, and width dimensions are interleaved and assigned 24, 20, and 20 rotary angles, respectively. This redistribution fosters a more balanced representation of both local semantics and long-range dependencies, thereby enhancing the model&#8217;s overall performance. The application of TM-RoPE is tailored to the specific modality of the input data. For text inputs, the three components share identical position identifiers, rendering TM-RoPE functionally equivalent to a one-dimensional RoPE <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep\">(Su et al., <a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2509.17765v1#bib.bib47\" title=\"\">2024</a>)</cite>. Similarly, audio inputs utilize shared position IDs but are further augmented with absolute temporal encodings, where each temporal ID corresponds to a duration of 80 ms. For image data, a constant temporal ID is assigned to all visual tokens, while their distinct row and column positions determine the height and width IDs.</p>\n\n",

Across 36 audio and audio-visual benchmarks, Qwen3-Omni achieves open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) on 32 benchmarks and overall SOTA on 22, outperforming strong closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro, Seed-ASR, and GPT-4o-Transcribe.\nQwen3-Omni adopts a Thinker&#8211;Talker Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that unifies perception and generation across text, images, audio, and video, yielding fluent text and natural real-time speech. It supports text interaction in 119 languages, speech understanding in 19 languages and speech generation in 10 languages. The system can process audio recordings up to 40 minutes per instance for ASR and spoken-language understanding, enabling high-quality audio and audiovisual experiences across locales. It demonstrates strong instruction following and allows fine-grained customization of conversational tone and persona via user-defined system prompts.\nTo reduce first-packet latency in streaming synthesis, the Talker autoregressively predicts discrete speech codecs using a multi-codebook scheme. Leveraging the representational capacity of these codebooks, we replace computationally intensive block-wise diffusion with a lightweight causal ConvNet, enabling streaming from the first codec frame. In cold-start settings (no prior context), Qwen3-Omni achieves a theoretical end-to-end first-packet latency of 234 ms.\nTo further strengthen multimodal reasoning, we introduce a Thinking model that explicitly reasons over inputs from any modality. Since the research community currently lacks a general-purpose audio captioning model, we fine-tuned Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B to obtain Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner, which produces detailed, low-hallucination captions for arbitrary audio inputs. Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B, Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking and Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner are publicly released under the Apache 2.0 license.</p>\n\n",

We demonstrate that joint multimodal training can achieve parity across all modalities&#8212;i.e., no modality-specific performance degradation&#8212;while markedly enhancing cross-modal capabilities such as video understanding. A key ingredient is mixing unimodal and cross-modal data during the early stage of text pretraining. As evidenced by Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Base, its text and vision performance is on par with same-sized single-modal text and vision base models across extensive benchmarks, while simultaneously exhibiting strong audio competence, audiovisual understanding, cross-modal &#8220;thinking&#8221;, and real-time audiovisual interaction. The development of non-degrading multimodal systems is an achievable objective. Such systems are characterized by two key properties: first, their ability to match the performance of specialized unimodal models in their respective tasks, and second, their capacity to facilitate novel cross-modal reasoning and interaction. These latter capabilities represent a significant advantage, as they are not present in traditional unimodal approaches.</p>\n\n",

During training, the filter bank features of the audio are downsampled 8 times using Conv2D blocks before the attention layers, reducing the token rate to 12.5 Hz. To learn stronger and more general-purpose audio representations, AuT is trained on large-scale audio datasets with both speech recognition and audio understanding tasks. Specifically, the training data includes 80% Chinese and English pseudo-labeled ASR data, 10% ASR data from other languages, and 10% audio understanding data. To balance the efficiency of real-time prefill caching with the performance for offline audio tasks, AuT utilizes flash attention with dynamic attention window sizes, covering attention query patterns ranging from 1 to 8 seconds. In Qwen3-Omni, we employ the AuT encoder as the audio encoder, which contains approximately 0.6B parameters.</p>\n\n",

TM-RoPE factorizes the conventional rotary position embedding into three distinct dimensions: temporal, height, and width. In the original M-RoPE formulation, temporal dependencies are modeled using the initial 16 rotary angles, which correspond to higher frequencies and exhibit stronger oscillatory patterns. While this design is effective for capturing fine-grained local temporal variations, it can impede the model&#8217;s ability to extrapolate over extended sequences. To address this limitation, we introduce a modified allocation of rotary angles. Specifically, the temporal, height, and width dimensions are interleaved and assigned 24, 20, and 20 rotary angles, respectively. This redistribution fosters a more balanced representation of both local semantics and long-range dependencies, thereby enhancing the model&#8217;s overall performance. The application of TM-RoPE is tailored to the specific modality of the input data. For text inputs, the three components share identical position identifiers, rendering TM-RoPE functionally equivalent to a one-dimensional RoPE <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep\">(Su et al., <a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2509.17765v1#bib.bib47\" title=\"\">2024</a>)</cite>. Similarly, audio inputs utilize shared position IDs but are further augmented with absolute temporal encodings, where each temporal ID corresponds to a duration of 80 ms. For image data, a constant temporal ID is assigned to all visual tokens, while their distinct row and column positions determine the height and width IDs.</p>\n\n",

Qwen3-Omni matches the performance of same-sized single-modal models within the Qwen series and excels particularly on audio tasks. Across 36 audio and audio-visual benchmarks, Qwen3-Omni achieves open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) on 32 benchmarks and overall SOTA on 22, outperforming strong closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro, Seed-ASR, and GPT-4o-Transcribe.\nQwen3-Omni adopts a Thinker&#8211;Talker Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that unifies perception and generation across text, images, audio, and video, yielding fluent text and natural real-time speech. It supports text interaction in 119 languages, speech understanding in 19 languages and speech generation in 10 languages. The system can process audio recordings up to 40 minutes per instance for ASR and spoken-language understanding, enabling high-quality audio and audiovisual experiences across locales. It demonstrates strong instruction following and allows fine-grained customization of conversational tone and persona via user-defined system prompts.\nTo reduce first-packet latency in streaming synthesis, the Talker autoregressively predicts discrete speech codecs using a multi-codebook scheme. Leveraging the representational capacity of these codebooks, we replace computationally intensive block-wise diffusion with a lightweight causal ConvNet, enabling streaming from the first codec frame. In cold-start settings (no prior context), Qwen3-Omni achieves a theoretical end-to-end first-packet latency of 234 ms.\nTo further strengthen multimodal reasoning, we introduce a Thinking model that explicitly reasons over inputs from any modality. Since the research community currently lacks a general-purpose audio captioning model, we fine-tuned Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B to obtain Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner, which produces detailed, low-hallucination captions for arbitrary audio inputs.

A key ingredient is mixing unimodal and cross-modal data during the early stage of text pretraining.

TM-RoPE factorizes the conventional rotary position embedding into three distinct dimensions: temporal, height, and width. In the original M-RoPE formulation, temporal dependencies are modeled using the initial 16 rotary angles, which correspond to higher frequencies and exhibit stronger oscillatory patterns. While this design is effective for capturing fine-grained local temporal variations, it can impede the model&#8217;s ability to extrapolate over extended sequences. To address this limitation, we introduce a modified allocation of rotary angles. Specifically, the temporal, height, and width dimensions are interleaved and assigned 24, 20, and 20 rotary angles, respectively. This redistribution fosters a more balanced representation of both local semantics and long-range dependencies, thereby enhancing the model&#8217;s overall performance. The application of TM-RoPE is tailored to the specific modality of the input data.

To isolate the effects of multimodality, all confounding variables were meticulously controlled. Specifically, the Omni model was trained on the identical text and vision corpora as the unimodal baselines. Moreover, we aligned critical training parameters across all models, including learning rate schedules, batch sizes, and the effective number of training epochs for each modality, which was normalized by adjusting data sampling ratios.

Qwen3-Omni matches the performance of same-sized single-modal models within the Qwen series and excels particularly on audio tasks. Across 36 audio and audio-visual benchmarks, Qwen3-Omni achieves open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) on 32 benchmarks and overall SOTA on 22, outperforming strong closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro, Seed-ASR, and GPT-4o-Transcribe.\nQwen3-Omni adopts a Thinker&#8211;Talker Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that unifies perception and generation across text, images, audio, and video, yielding fluent text and natural real-time speech. It supports text interaction in 119 languages, speech understanding in 19 languages and speech generation in 10 languages. The system can process audio recordings up to 40 minutes per instance for ASR and spoken-language understanding, enabling high-quality audio and audiovisual experiences across locales. It demonstrates strong instruction following and allows fine-grained customization of conversational tone and persona via user-defined system prompts.\nTo reduce first-packet latency in streaming synthesis, the Talker autoregressively predicts discrete speech codecs using a multi-codebook scheme. Leveraging the representational capacity of these codebooks, we replace computationally intensive block-wise diffusion with a lightweight causal ConvNet, enabling streaming from the first codec frame. In cold-start settings (no prior context), Qwen3-Omni achieves a theoretical end-to-end first-packet latency of 234 ms.\nTo further strengthen multimodal reasoning, we introduce a Thinking model that explicitly reasons over inputs from any modality. Since the research community currently lacks a general-purpose audio captioning model, we fine-tuned Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B to obtain Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner, which produces detailed, low-hallucination captions for arbitrary audio inputs.

Qwen3-Omni matches the performance of same-sized single-modal models within the Qwen series and excels particularly on audio tasks. Across 36 audio and audio-visual benchmarks, Qwen3-Omni achieves open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) on 32 benchmarks and overall SOTA on 22, outperforming strong closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro, Seed-ASR, and GPT-4o-Transcribe.\nQwen3-Omni adopts a Thinker&#8211;Talker Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that unifies perception and generation across text, images, audio, and video, yielding fluent text and natural real-time speech. It supports text interaction in 119 languages, speech understanding in 19 languages and speech generation in 10 languages. The system can process audio recordings up to 40 minutes per instance for ASR and spoken-language understanding, enabling high-quality audio and audiovisual experiences across locales. It demonstrates strong instruction following and allows fine-grained customization of conversational tone and persona via user-defined system prompts.\nTo reduce first-packet latency in streaming synthesis, the Talker autoregressively predicts discrete speech codecs using a multi-codebook scheme. Leveraging the representational capacity of these codebooks, we replace computationally intensive block-wise diffusion with a lightweight causal ConvNet, enabling streaming from the first codec frame. In cold-start settings (no prior context), Qwen3-Omni achieves a theoretical end-to-end first-packet latency of 234 ms.\nTo further strengthen multimodal reasoning, we introduce a Thinking model that explicitly reasons over inputs from any modality. Since the research community currently lacks a general-purpose audio captioning model, we fine-tuned Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B to obtain Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner, which produces detailed, low-hallucination captions for arbitrary audio inputs. Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B, Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking and Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner are publicly released under the Apache 2.0 license.</p>\n\n",

To learn stronger and more general-purpose audio representations, AuT is trained on large-scale audio datasets with both speech recognition and audio understanding tasks. Specifically, the training data includes 80% Chinese and English pseudo-labeled ASR data, 10% ASR data from other languages, and 10% audio understanding data. To balance the efficiency of real-time prefill caching with the performance for offline audio tasks, AuT utilizes flash attention with dynamic attention window sizes, covering attention query patterns ranging from 1 to 8 seconds.

This approach significantly reduces the Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) for both the Thinker and the Talker. Architecturally, both Thinker and the Talker in Qwen3-Omni adopt the MoE design, which is highly effective for improving service throughput.

Several factors influence the total first-packet latency. First, the model sizes of Thinker and Talker impact their tail packet preprocessing latency (multi-modal data preprocessing and inference for Audio and Vision Encoder) and Time-To-First-Token (TTPT). Second, the architectures and sizes of the MTP Module and Codec Decoder affect their inference latency. Due to the sequential dependency between these components, the total first-packet latency represents the sum of these individual latencies. As shown in the results, the MoE architecture of Thinker and Talker ensures that their prefill latency and TTPT remain largely unaffected under high concurrency. Meanwhile, the lightweight design of the MTP Module and Codec Decoder minimizes their computational overhead, resulting in a lower impact on first-packet latency. Furthermore, after the initial packet is output and the model starts streaming audio synthesis, the 12.5Hz token rate Talker requires only one token to synthesize 80ms audio. Consequently, the Generation Real Time Factor (RTF) is calculated by dividing the sum of: (1) the time taken by Thinker and Talker to generate one token; and (2) the processing time per token for the MTP Module and Codec Decoder by 80ms. As demonstrated, the RTF consistently remains below 1 across varying concurrency levels, ensuring that users receive continuously streaming audio responses.</p>\n\n",

Qwen3-Omni matches the performance of same-sized single-modal models within the Qwen series and excels particularly on audio tasks. Across 36 audio and audio-visual benchmarks, Qwen3-Omni achieves open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) on 32 benchmarks and overall SOTA on 22, outperforming strong closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro, Seed-ASR, and GPT-4o-Transcribe.\nQwen3-Omni adopts a Thinker&#8211;Talker Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that unifies perception and generation across text, images, audio, and video, yielding fluent text and natural real-time speech. It supports text interaction in 119 languages, speech understanding in 19 languages and speech generation in 10 languages. The system can process audio recordings up to 40 minutes per instance for ASR and spoken-language understanding, enabling high-quality audio and audiovisual experiences across locales. It demonstrates strong instruction following and allows fine-grained customization of conversational tone and persona via user-defined system prompts.\nTo reduce first-packet latency in streaming synthesis, the Talker autoregressively predicts discrete speech codecs using a multi-codebook scheme. Leveraging the representational capacity of these codebooks, we replace computationally intensive block-wise diffusion with a lightweight causal ConvNet, enabling streaming from the first codec frame. In cold-start settings (no prior context), Qwen3-Omni achieves a theoretical end-to-end first-packet latency of 234 ms.\nTo further strengthen multimodal reasoning, we introduce a Thinking model that explicitly reasons over inputs from any modality. Since the research community currently lacks a general-purpose audio captioning model, we fine-tuned Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B to obtain Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner, which produces detailed, low-hallucination captions for arbitrary audio inputs. Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B, Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking and Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner are publicly released under the Apache 2.0 license.</p>\n\n",

Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B matches or surpasses the latest same-size unimodal Qwen models on text and vision benchmarks. Notably, on audio processing and dialogue benchmarks, it attains state-of-the-art performance among open-source systems on 32 benchmarks and is comparable to, or better than, the strong proprietary counterpart Gemini-2.5-Pro. The Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B Thinking variant achieves further gains on complex tasks spanning text, vision, and audio-visual reasoning. Beyond accuracy, the model supports 119 text languages, 19 languages for speech recognition and 10 languages for speech synthesis, and enables audio understanding and interactive sessions up to 40 minutes. Thanks to its streaming architecture and multi-codebook design, Qwen3-Omni at the 30B-A3B scale still delivers an end-to-end first-packet latency of 234 ms.</p>\n\n",

Qwen3-Omni matches the performance of same-sized single-modal models within the Qwen series and excels particularly on audio tasks. Across 36 audio and audio-visual benchmarks, Qwen3-Omni achieves open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) on 32 benchmarks and overall SOTA on 22, outperforming strong closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro, Seed-ASR, and GPT-4o-Transcribe.\nQwen3-Omni adopts a Thinker&#8211;Talker Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that unifies perception and generation across text, images, audio, and video, yielding fluent text and natural real-time speech. It supports text interaction in 119 languages, speech understanding in 19 languages and speech generation in 10 languages. The system can process audio recordings up to 40 minutes per instance for ASR and spoken-language understanding, enabling high-quality audio and audiovisual experiences across locales. It demonstrates strong instruction following and allows fine-grained customization of conversational tone and persona via user-defined system prompts.\nTo reduce first-packet latency in streaming synthesis, the Talker autoregressively predicts discrete speech codecs using a multi-codebook scheme. Leveraging the representational capacity of these codebooks, we replace computationally intensive block-wise diffusion with a lightweight causal ConvNet, enabling streaming from the first codec frame. In cold-start settings (no prior context), Qwen3-Omni achieves a theoretical end-to-end first-packet latency of 234 ms.\nTo further strengthen multimodal reasoning, we introduce a Thinking model that explicitly reasons over inputs from any modality. Since the research community currently lacks a general-purpose audio captioning model, we fine-tuned Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B to obtain Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner, which produces detailed, low-hallucination captions for arbitrary audio inputs. Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B, Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking and Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner are publicly released under the Apache 2.0 license.</p>\n\n",

We demonstrate that joint multimodal training can achieve parity across all modalities&#8212;i.e., no modality-specific performance degradation&#8212;while markedly enhancing cross-modal capabilities such as video understanding. A key ingredient is mixing unimodal and cross-modal data during the early stage of text pretraining. As evidenced by Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Base, its text and vision performance is on par with same-sized single-modal text and vision base models across extensive benchmarks, while simultaneously exhibiting strong audio competence, audiovisual understanding, cross-modal &#8220;thinking&#8221;, and real-time audiovisual interaction. The development of non-degrading multimodal systems is an achievable objective. Such systems are characterized by two key properties: first, their ability to match the performance of specialized unimodal models in their respective tasks, and second, their capacity to facilitate novel cross-modal reasoning and interaction. These latter capabilities represent a significant advantage, as they are not present in traditional unimodal approaches.</p>\n\n",

In the original M-RoPE formulation, temporal dependencies are modeled using the initial 16 rotary angles, which correspond to higher frequencies and exhibit stronger oscillatory patterns. While this design is effective for capturing fine-grained local temporal variations, it can impede the model&#8217;s ability to extrapolate over extended sequences. To address this limitation, we introduce a modified allocation of rotary angles. Specifically, the temporal, height, and width dimensions are interleaved and assigned 24, 20, and 20 rotary angles, respectively. This redistribution fosters a more balanced representation of both local semantics and long-range dependencies, thereby enhancing the model&#8217;s overall performance. The application of TM-RoPE is tailored to the specific modality of the input data. For text inputs, the three components share identical position identifiers, rendering TM-RoPE functionally equivalent to a one-dimensional RoPE <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep\">(Su et al., <a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2509.17765v1#bib.bib47\" title=\"\">2024</a>)</cite>. Similarly, audio inputs utilize shared position IDs but are further augmented with absolute temporal encodings, where each temporal ID corresponds to a duration of 80 ms. For image data, a constant temporal ID is assigned to all visual tokens, while their distinct row and column positions determine the height and width IDs.</p>\n\n",

The video is treated as a sequence of frames with monotonically increasing temporal IDs that are dynamically adjusted based on their actual timestamps to ensure a consistent temporal resolution of 80 ms per ID. The height and width IDs for video frames are assigned in the same manner as for still images. To prevent positional conflicts when processing multiple modalities, the position numbering is made contiguous, with each subsequent modality commencing from one plus the maximum position ID of the preceding modality. This refined approach to positional encoding enables the model to effectively integrate and jointly model information from diverse modalities. In a departure from Qwen2.5-Omni, which segments audiovisual representations into fixed 2-second chunks, Qwen3-Omni directly aligns these representations using their temporal IDs, which are explicitly anchored to absolute time. This design choice affords the model the flexibility to support streaming inputs of arbitrary duration.</p>\n\n",

The Talker employs a hierarchical prediction scheme: the backbone ingests the aggregated codebook features of the current frame and uses a linear head to predict the zeroth codebook, after which a multi-token prediction (MTP) module generates all residual codebooks. This strategy enables the model to learn a complete representation of acoustic details, enhancing vocal expressivity. Consequently, waveform reconstruction is simplified to a lightweight causal ConvNet (Code2Wav), which significantly reduces inference latency and computational cost (FLOPs) while achieving superior audio fidelity compared to more complex DiT-based vocoders.</p>\n\n",

Several factors influence the total first-packet latency. First, the model sizes of Thinker and Talker impact their tail packet preprocessing latency (multi-modal data preprocessing and inference for Audio and Vision Encoder) and Time-To-First-Token (TTPT). Second, the architectures and sizes of the MTP Module and Codec Decoder affect their inference latency. Due to the sequential dependency between these components, the total first-packet latency represents the sum of these individual latencies. As shown in the results, the MoE architecture of Thinker and Talker ensures that their prefill latency and TTPT remain largely unaffected under high concurrency. Meanwhile, the lightweight design of the MTP Module and Codec Decoder minimizes their computational overhead, resulting in a lower impact on first-packet latency. Furthermore, after the initial packet is output and the model starts streaming audio synthesis, the 12.5Hz token rate Talker requires only one token to synthesize 80ms audio. Consequently, the Generation Real Time Factor (RTF) is calculated by dividing the sum of: (1) the time taken by Thinker and Talker to generate one token; and (2) the processing time per token for the MTP Module and Codec Decoder by 80ms. As demonstrated, the RTF consistently remains below 1 across varying concurrency levels, ensuring that users receive continuously streaming audio responses.</p>\n\n",

Qwen3-Omni matches the performance of same-sized single-modal models within the Qwen series and excels particularly on audio tasks. Across 36 audio and audio-visual benchmarks, Qwen3-Omni achieves open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) on 32 benchmarks and overall SOTA on 22, outperforming strong closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro, Seed-ASR, and GPT-4o-Transcribe.\nQwen3-Omni adopts a Thinker&#8211;Talker Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that unifies perception and generation across text, images, audio, and video, yielding fluent text and natural real-time speech. It supports text interaction in 119 languages, speech understanding in 19 languages and speech generation in 10 languages. The system can process audio recordings up to 40 minutes per instance for ASR and spoken-language understanding, enabling high-quality audio and audiovisual experiences across locales. It demonstrates strong instruction following and allows fine-grained customization of conversational tone and persona via user-defined system prompts.\nTo reduce first-packet latency in streaming synthesis, the Talker autoregressively predicts discrete speech codecs using a multi-codebook scheme. Leveraging the representational capacity of these codebooks, we replace computationally intensive block-wise diffusion with a lightweight causal ConvNet, enabling streaming from the first codec frame. In cold-start settings (no prior context), Qwen3-Omni achieves a theoretical end-to-end first-packet latency of 234 ms.\nTo further strengthen multimodal reasoning, we introduce a Thinking model that explicitly reasons over inputs from any modality. Since the research community currently lacks a general-purpose audio captioning model, we fine-tuned Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B to obtain Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner, which produces detailed, low-hallucination captions for arbitrary audio inputs. Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B, Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking and Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner are publicly released under the Apache 2.0 license.</p>\n\n",

We demonstrate that joint multimodal training can achieve parity across all modalities&#8212;i.e., no modality-specific performance degradation&#8212;while markedly enhancing cross-modal capabilities such as video understanding. A key ingredient is mixing unimodal and cross-modal data during the early stage of text pretraining. As evidenced by Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Base, its text and vision performance is on par with same-sized single-modal text and vision base models across extensive benchmarks, while simultaneously exhibiting strong audio competence, audiovisual understanding, cross-modal &#8220;thinking&#8221;, and real-time audiovisual interaction. The development of non-degrading multimodal systems is an achievable objective. Such systems are characterized by two key properties: first, their ability to match the performance of specialized unimodal models in their respective tasks, and second, their capacity to facilitate novel cross-modal reasoning and interaction. These latter capabilities represent a significant advantage, as they are not present in traditional unimodal approaches.</p>\n\n",

During training, the filter bank features of the audio are downsampled 8 times using Conv2D blocks before the attention layers, reducing the token rate to 12.5 Hz. To learn stronger and more general-purpose audio representations, AuT is trained on large-scale audio datasets with both speech recognition and audio understanding tasks. Specifically, the training data includes 80% Chinese and English pseudo-labeled ASR data, 10% ASR data from other languages, and 10% audio understanding data. To balance the efficiency of real-time prefill caching with the performance for offline audio tasks, AuT utilizes flash attention with dynamic attention window sizes, covering attention query patterns ranging from 1 to 8 seconds.

Qwen3-Omni matches the performance of same-sized single-modal models within the Qwen series and excels particularly on audio tasks. Across 36 audio and audio-visual benchmarks, Qwen3-Omni achieves open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) on 32 benchmarks and overall SOTA on 22, outperforming strong closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro, Seed-ASR, and GPT-4o-Transcribe.\nQwen3-Omni adopts a Thinker&#8211;Talker Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that unifies perception and generation across text, images, audio, and video, yielding fluent text and natural real-time speech. It supports text interaction in 119 languages, speech understanding in 19 languages and speech generation in 10 languages. The system can process audio recordings up to 40 minutes per instance for ASR and spoken-language understanding, enabling high-quality audio and audiovisual experiences across locales. It demonstrates strong instruction following and allows fine-grained customization of conversational tone and persona via user-defined system prompts.\nTo reduce first-packet latency in streaming synthesis, the Talker autoregressively predicts discrete speech codecs using a multi-codebook scheme. Leveraging the representational capacity of these codebooks, we replace computationally intensive block-wise diffusion with a lightweight causal ConvNet, enabling streaming from the first codec frame. In cold-start settings (no prior context), Qwen3-Omni achieves a theoretical end-to-end first-packet latency of 234 ms.\nTo further strengthen multimodal reasoning, we introduce a Thinking model that explicitly reasons over inputs from any modality. Since the research community currently lacks a general-purpose audio captioning model, we fine-tuned Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B to obtain Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner, which produces detailed, low-hallucination captions for arbitrary audio inputs.

We demonstrate that joint multimodal training can achieve parity across all modalities&#8212;i.e., no modality-specific performance degradation&#8212;while markedly enhancing cross-modal capabilities such as video understanding. A key ingredient is mixing unimodal and cross-modal data during the early stage of text pretraining. As evidenced by Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Base, its text and vision performance is on par with same-sized single-modal text and vision base models across extensive benchmarks, while simultaneously exhibiting strong audio competence, audiovisual understanding, cross-modal &#8220;thinking&#8221;, and real-time audiovisual interaction. The development of non-degrading multimodal systems is an achievable objective. Such systems are characterized by two key properties: first, their ability to match the performance of specialized unimodal models in their respective tasks, and second, their capacity to facilitate novel cross-modal reasoning and interaction. These latter capabilities represent a significant advantage, as they are not present in traditional unimodal approaches.</p>\n\n",

Specifically, the training data includes 80% Chinese and English pseudo-labeled ASR data, 10% ASR data from other languages, and 10% audio understanding data. To balance the efficiency of real-time prefill caching with the performance for offline audio tasks, AuT utilizes flash attention with dynamic attention window sizes, covering attention query patterns ranging from 1 to 8 seconds.
