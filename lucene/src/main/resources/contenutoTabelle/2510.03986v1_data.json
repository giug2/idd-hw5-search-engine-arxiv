Speech intelligibility significantly impacts communication, leading to barriers in social interactions. Dysarthria is often a characteristic of neurological diseases including Parkinson&#8217;s and ALS, yet current tools lack generalizability across languages and levels of severity. In this study, we present a unified AI-based multilingual framework that addresses six key components: (1) binary dysarthria detection, (2) severity classification, (3) clean speech generation, (4) speech-to-text conversion, (5) emotion detection, and (6) voice cloning. We analyze datasets in English, Russian, and German, using spectrogram-based visualizations and acoustic feature extraction to inform model training. Our binary detection model achieved 97% accuracy across all three languages, demonstrating strong generalization across languages. The severity classification model also reached 97% test accuracy, with interpretable results showing model attention focused on lower harmonics. Our translation pipeline, trained on paired Russian dysarthric and clean speech, reconstructed intelligible outputs with low training (0.03) and test (0.06) L1 losses. Given the limited availability of English dysarthric-clean pairs, we finetuned the Russian model on English data and achieved improved losses of 0.02 (train) and 0.03 (test), highlighting the promise of cross-lingual transfer learning for low-resource settings. Our speech-to-text pipeline achieved a Word Error Rate of 0.1367 after three epochs, indicating accurate transcription on dysarthric speech and enabling downstream emotion recognition and voice cloning from transcribed speech. Overall, the results and products of this study can be used to diagnose dysarthria and improve communication and understanding for patients across different languages.</p>\n\n",

It arises when the nervous system damage impairs the muscles involved in speaking, leading to slurred, slow speech that is difficult to understand <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite\">[<a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03986v1#bib.bib2\" title=\"\">2</a>]</cite>. While not a disease itself, dysarthria significantly impairs communication and quality of life, frequently leading to social isolation, misdiagnosis, or reduced access to care. Studies report that dysarthria occurs in up to 60% of stroke patients and affects as many as 90% of individuals with Parkinson&#8217;s disease <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite\">[<a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03986v1#bib.bib3\" title=\"\">3</a>]</cite>.

A recent study demonstrated that a listener&#8217;s native language significantly influences their perceptual ratings of dysarthria, particularly for articulatory and rhythmic characteristics <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite\">[<a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03986v1#bib.bib5\" title=\"\">5</a>]</cite>. This highlights a fundamental limitation in human-based assessment, as a clinician&#8217;s ability to accurately perceive and rate a speaker&#8217;s dysarthria can be compromised when they are not a native speaker of the language. This suggests that current diagnostic methods that rely on subjective evaluations by speech-language pathologists are constrained by language familiarity and clinical access. Furthermore, they are prone to human error and bias, which can delay proper treatment, especially for early stage dysarthria <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite\">[<a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03986v1#bib.bib6\" title=\"\">6</a>, <a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03986v1#bib.bib7\" title=\"\">7</a>]</cite>.</p>\n\n",

This cross-linguistic robustness is promising for improved dysarthria classification in other languages without as much available data.\nUsing a CNN for spectrogram-based severity detection also yielded promising and interpretable results, which enables early detection of dysarthria that a human examiner may not be able to pick up. Saliency heatmaps show that across all classes, the model is focusing on the lower harmonics, centered around the timepoints and frequencies that the signal lies in.

Speech intelligibility significantly impacts communication, leading to barriers in social interactions. Dysarthria is often a characteristic of neurological diseases including Parkinson&#8217;s and ALS, yet current tools lack generalizability across languages and levels of severity. In this study, we present a unified AI-based multilingual framework that addresses six key components: (1) binary dysarthria detection, (2) severity classification, (3) clean speech generation, (4) speech-to-text conversion, (5) emotion detection, and (6) voice cloning. We analyze datasets in English, Russian, and German, using spectrogram-based visualizations and acoustic feature extraction to inform model training. Our binary detection model achieved 97% accuracy across all three languages, demonstrating strong generalization across languages. The severity classification model also reached 97% test accuracy, with interpretable results showing model attention focused on lower harmonics. Our translation pipeline, trained on paired Russian dysarthric and clean speech, reconstructed intelligible outputs with low training (0.03) and test (0.06) L1 losses. Given the limited availability of English dysarthric-clean pairs, we finetuned the Russian model on English data and achieved improved losses of 0.02 (train) and 0.03 (test), highlighting the promise of cross-lingual transfer learning for low-resource settings. Our speech-to-text pipeline achieved a Word Error Rate of 0.1367 after three epochs, indicating accurate transcription on dysarthric speech and enabling downstream emotion recognition and voice cloning from transcribed speech. Overall, the results and products of this study can be used to diagnose dysarthria and improve communication and understanding for patients across different languages.</p>\n\n",

Speech intelligibility significantly impacts communication, leading to barriers in social interactions. Dysarthria is often a characteristic of neurological diseases including Parkinson&#8217;s and ALS, yet current tools lack generalizability across languages and levels of severity. In this study, we present a unified AI-based multilingual framework that addresses six key components: (1) binary dysarthria detection, (2) severity classification, (3) clean speech generation, (4) speech-to-text conversion, (5) emotion detection, and (6) voice cloning. We analyze datasets in English, Russian, and German, using spectrogram-based visualizations and acoustic feature extraction to inform model training. Our binary detection model achieved 97% accuracy across all three languages, demonstrating strong generalization across languages. The severity classification model also reached 97% test accuracy, with interpretable results showing model attention focused on lower harmonics. Our translation pipeline, trained on paired Russian dysarthric and clean speech, reconstructed intelligible outputs with low training (0.03) and test (0.06) L1 losses. Given the limited availability of English dysarthric-clean pairs, we finetuned the Russian model on English data and achieved improved losses of 0.02 (train) and 0.03 (test), highlighting the promise of cross-lingual transfer learning for low-resource settings. Our speech-to-text pipeline achieved a Word Error Rate of 0.1367 after three epochs, indicating accurate transcription on dysarthric speech and enabling downstream emotion recognition and voice cloning from transcribed speech. Overall, the results and products of this study can be used to diagnose dysarthria and improve communication and understanding for patients across different languages.</p>\n\n",

Speech intelligibility significantly impacts communication, leading to barriers in social interactions. Dysarthria is often a characteristic of neurological diseases including Parkinson&#8217;s and ALS, yet current tools lack generalizability across languages and levels of severity. In this study, we present a unified AI-based multilingual framework that addresses six key components: (1) binary dysarthria detection, (2) severity classification, (3) clean speech generation, (4) speech-to-text conversion, (5) emotion detection, and (6) voice cloning. We analyze datasets in English, Russian, and German, using spectrogram-based visualizations and acoustic feature extraction to inform model training. Our binary detection model achieved 97% accuracy across all three languages, demonstrating strong generalization across languages. The severity classification model also reached 97% test accuracy, with interpretable results showing model attention focused on lower harmonics. Our translation pipeline, trained on paired Russian dysarthric and clean speech, reconstructed intelligible outputs with low training (0.03) and test (0.06) L1 losses. Given the limited availability of English dysarthric-clean pairs, we finetuned the Russian model on English data and achieved improved losses of 0.02 (train) and 0.03 (test), highlighting the promise of cross-lingual transfer learning for low-resource settings. Our speech-to-text pipeline achieved a Word Error Rate of 0.1367 after three epochs, indicating accurate transcription on dysarthric speech and enabling downstream emotion recognition and voice cloning from transcribed speech. Overall, the results and products of this study can be used to diagnose dysarthria and improve communication and understanding for patients across different languages.</p>\n\n",

It arises when the nervous system damage impairs the muscles involved in speaking, leading to slurred, slow speech that is difficult to understand <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite\">[<a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03986v1#bib.bib2\" title=\"\">2</a>]</cite>. While not a disease itself, dysarthria significantly impairs communication and quality of life, frequently leading to social isolation, misdiagnosis, or reduced access to care.

This highlights a fundamental limitation in human-based assessment, as a clinician&#8217;s ability to accurately perceive and rate a speaker&#8217;s dysarthria can be compromised when they are not a native speaker of the language. This suggests that current diagnostic methods that rely on subjective evaluations by speech-language pathologists are constrained by language familiarity and clinical access.

Speech intelligibility significantly impacts communication, leading to barriers in social interactions. Dysarthria is often a characteristic of neurological diseases including Parkinson&#8217;s and ALS, yet current tools lack generalizability across languages and levels of severity. In this study, we present a unified AI-based multilingual framework that addresses six key components: (1) binary dysarthria detection, (2) severity classification, (3) clean speech generation, (4) speech-to-text conversion, (5) emotion detection, and (6) voice cloning. We analyze datasets in English, Russian, and German, using spectrogram-based visualizations and acoustic feature extraction to inform model training. Our binary detection model achieved 97% accuracy across all three languages, demonstrating strong generalization across languages. The severity classification model also reached 97% test accuracy, with interpretable results showing model attention focused on lower harmonics. Our translation pipeline, trained on paired Russian dysarthric and clean speech, reconstructed intelligible outputs with low training (0.03) and test (0.06) L1 losses. Given the limited availability of English dysarthric-clean pairs, we finetuned the Russian model on English data and achieved improved losses of 0.02 (train) and 0.03 (test), highlighting the promise of cross-lingual transfer learning for low-resource settings. Our speech-to-text pipeline achieved a Word Error Rate of 0.1367 after three epochs, indicating accurate transcription on dysarthric speech and enabling downstream emotion recognition and voice cloning from transcribed speech. Overall, the results and products of this study can be used to diagnose dysarthria and improve communication and understanding for patients across different languages.</p>\n\n",

This speech codec model encodes a speaker&#8217;s vocal characteristics in a sequence of discrete tokens. The pipeline packages the speech tokens with the output from the speech-to-text pipeline, and feeds it into a LLASA-3B model which is fine-tuned to generate speech token sequences based on the text and speaker voice tokens. The generated speech tokens are then passed back onto the XCodec2 decoded to synthesize audio.</p>\n\n",

First, our English speech-to-speech model was fine-tuned on a small paired dataset, which may restrict generalization across broader accents or sentence structures. Second, the emotion classifier was trained solely on clean transcriptions and may not fully capture emotion from more spontaneous or emotionally complex utterances. Finally, while our cross-lingual transfer approach worked well from Russian to English, its effectiveness across more structurally distant language pairs remains untested.\nFuture work includes expanding our dataset to include more diverse speakers and dialects, improving robustness to spontaneous speech, and testing the framework on additional low-resource languages. We also aim to refine the voice cloning pipeline to better preserve speaker identity over longer and more variable inputs.</p>\n\n",
