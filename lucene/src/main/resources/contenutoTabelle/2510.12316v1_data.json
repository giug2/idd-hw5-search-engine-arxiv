Yet, existing work treats counter-speech generation as pure text generation task, mainly based on Large Language Models or NGO experts. These approaches show severe drawbacks due to the limited reliability and coherence in the generated countering text, and in scalability, respectively. To close this gap, we introduce a novel framework to model counter-speech generation as knowledge-wise text generation process. Our framework integrates advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines to ensure the generation of trustworthy counter-speech for 8 main target groups identified in the hate speech literature, including women, people of colour, persons with disabilities, migrants, Muslims, Jews, LGBT persons, and other. We built a knowledge base over the United Nations Digital Library, EUR-Lex and the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, comprising a total of 32,792 texts. We use the MultiTarget-CONAN dataset to empirically assess the quality of the generated counter-speech, both through standard metrics (i.e., JudgeLM) and a human evaluation. Results show that our framework outperforms standard LLM baselines and competitive approach, on both assessments. The resulting framework and the knowledge base pave the way for studying trustworthy and sound counter-speech generation, in hate speech and beyond. <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic\" style=\"--ltx-fg-color:#FF0000;\">Warning<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_medium\">: this paper contains explicit examples some readers may find offensive.</span></span></p>\n\n",

Non-RAG outputs achieve slightly higher lexical and semantic overlap, suggesting that retrieval introduces content that, while factually richer, diverges from exact reference phrasing. RAG outputs show less words overlapping,\nlikely reflecting the inclusion of factual information from the knowledge base.\n<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">Diversity:</span> incorporating retrieval substantially improves lexical diversity and reduces repetition. Mistral with BGE-M3 shows the largest gains, while No-RAG models, particularly Mistral, exhibit high repetition and lower diversity. <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">Safety:</span> No-RAG configurations achieve the highest safety, with GPT leading (0.993). RAG outputs show slightly lower safety, likely due to occasional noise introduced from the retrieval process. Nevertheless, safety remains high overall, indicating that fact-grounded augmentation does not substantially compromise non-harmfulness.\n<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">Model-level Trends:</span> GPT consistently delivers the safest outputs and competitive BERTScore, though with lower lexical diversity than Mistral. Mistral excels in diversity with RAG but performs poorly in No-RAG due to high repetition. CommandR and LLaMA provide stable but moderate performance across metrics. Overall, RAG with BGE-M3 achieves the best balance between quality, diversity, and informativeness. All results differ significantly (see Appendix <a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2510.12316v1#A4\" title=\"Appendix D Statistical Significance of Retrieval Effects &#8227; Beating Harmful Stereotypes Through Facts: RAG-based Counter-speech Generation\"><span class=\"ltx_text ltx_ref_tag\">D</span></a> for more details).</p>\n\n"

Yet, existing work treats counter-speech generation as pure text generation task, mainly based on Large Language Models or NGO experts. These approaches show severe drawbacks due to the limited reliability and coherence in the generated countering text, and in scalability, respectively. To close this gap, we introduce a novel framework to model counter-speech generation as knowledge-wise text generation process. Our framework integrates advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines to ensure the generation of trustworthy counter-speech for 8 main target groups identified in the hate speech literature, including women, people of colour, persons with disabilities, migrants, Muslims, Jews, LGBT persons, and other. We built a knowledge base over the United Nations Digital Library, EUR-Lex and the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, comprising a total of 32,792 texts. We use the MultiTarget-CONAN dataset to empirically assess the quality of the generated counter-speech, both through standard metrics (i.e., JudgeLM) and a human evaluation. Results show that our framework outperforms standard LLM baselines and competitive approach, on both assessments. The resulting framework and the knowledge base pave the way for studying trustworthy and sound counter-speech generation, in hate speech and beyond. <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic\" style=\"--ltx-fg-color:#FF0000;\">Warning<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_medium\">: this paper contains explicit examples some readers may find offensive.</span></span></p>\n\n",

Yet, existing work treats counter-speech generation as pure text generation task, mainly based on Large Language Models or NGO experts. These approaches show severe drawbacks due to the limited reliability and coherence in the generated countering text, and in scalability, respectively. To close this gap, we introduce a novel framework to model counter-speech generation as knowledge-wise text generation process. Our framework integrates advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines to ensure the generation of trustworthy counter-speech for 8 main target groups identified in the hate speech literature, including women, people of colour, persons with disabilities, migrants, Muslims, Jews, LGBT persons, and other. We built a knowledge base over the United Nations Digital Library, EUR-Lex and the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, comprising a total of 32,792 texts. We use the MultiTarget-CONAN dataset to empirically assess the quality of the generated counter-speech, both through standard metrics (i.e., JudgeLM) and a human evaluation. Results show that our framework outperforms standard LLM baselines and competitive approach, on both assessments. The resulting framework and the knowledge base pave the way for studying trustworthy and sound counter-speech generation, in hate speech and beyond. <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic\" style=\"--ltx-fg-color:#FF0000;\">Warning<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_medium\">: this paper contains explicit examples some readers may find offensive.</span></span></p>\n\n",

Yet, existing work treats counter-speech generation as pure text generation task, mainly based on Large Language Models or NGO experts. These approaches show severe drawbacks due to the limited reliability and coherence in the generated countering text, and in scalability, respectively. To close this gap, we introduce a novel framework to model counter-speech generation as knowledge-wise text generation process. Our framework integrates advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines to ensure the generation of trustworthy counter-speech for 8 main target groups identified in the hate speech literature, including women, people of colour, persons with disabilities, migrants, Muslims, Jews, LGBT persons, and other. We built a knowledge base over the United Nations Digital Library, EUR-Lex and the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, comprising a total of 32,792 texts. We use the MultiTarget-CONAN dataset to empirically assess the quality of the generated counter-speech, both through standard metrics (i.e., JudgeLM) and a human evaluation. Results show that our framework outperforms standard LLM baselines and competitive approach, on both assessments. The resulting framework and the knowledge base pave the way for studying trustworthy and sound counter-speech generation, in hate speech and beyond. <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic\" style=\"--ltx-fg-color:#FF0000;\">Warning<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_medium\">: this paper contains explicit examples some readers may find offensive.</span></span></p>\n\n",

Yet, existing work treats counter-speech generation as pure text generation task, mainly based on Large Language Models or NGO experts. These approaches show severe drawbacks due to the limited reliability and coherence in the generated countering text, and in scalability, respectively. To close this gap, we introduce a novel framework to model counter-speech generation as knowledge-wise text generation process. Our framework integrates advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines to ensure the generation of trustworthy counter-speech for 8 main target groups identified in the hate speech literature, including women, people of colour, persons with disabilities, migrants, Muslims, Jews, LGBT persons, and other. We built a knowledge base over the United Nations Digital Library, EUR-Lex and the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, comprising a total of 32,792 texts. We use the MultiTarget-CONAN dataset to empirically assess the quality of the generated counter-speech, both through standard metrics (i.e., JudgeLM) and a human evaluation. Results show that our framework outperforms standard LLM baselines and competitive approach, on both assessments. The resulting framework and the knowledge base pave the way for studying trustworthy and sound counter-speech generation, in hate speech and beyond. <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic\" style=\"--ltx-fg-color:#FF0000;\">Warning<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_medium\">: this paper contains explicit examples some readers may find offensive.</span></span></p>\n\n",

Yet, existing work treats counter-speech generation as pure text generation task, mainly based on Large Language Models or NGO experts. These approaches show severe drawbacks due to the limited reliability and coherence in the generated countering text, and in scalability, respectively. To close this gap, we introduce a novel framework to model counter-speech generation as knowledge-wise text generation process. Our framework integrates advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines to ensure the generation of trustworthy counter-speech for 8 main target groups identified in the hate speech literature, including women, people of colour, persons with disabilities, migrants, Muslims, Jews, LGBT persons, and other. We built a knowledge base over the United Nations Digital Library, EUR-Lex and the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, comprising a total of 32,792 texts. We use the MultiTarget-CONAN dataset to empirically assess the quality of the generated counter-speech, both through standard metrics (i.e., JudgeLM) and a human evaluation. Results show that our framework outperforms standard LLM baselines and competitive approach, on both assessments. The resulting framework and the knowledge base pave the way for studying trustworthy and sound counter-speech generation, in hate speech and beyond. <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic\" style=\"--ltx-fg-color:#FF0000;\">Warning<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_medium\">: this paper contains explicit examples some readers may find offensive.</span></span></p>\n\n",

Yet, existing work treats counter-speech generation as pure text generation task, mainly based on Large Language Models or NGO experts. These approaches show severe drawbacks due to the limited reliability and coherence in the generated countering text, and in scalability, respectively. To close this gap, we introduce a novel framework to model counter-speech generation as knowledge-wise text generation process. Our framework integrates advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines to ensure the generation of trustworthy counter-speech for 8 main target groups identified in the hate speech literature, including women, people of colour, persons with disabilities, migrants, Muslims, Jews, LGBT persons, and other. We built a knowledge base over the United Nations Digital Library, EUR-Lex and the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, comprising a total of 32,792 texts. We use the MultiTarget-CONAN dataset to empirically assess the quality of the generated counter-speech, both through standard metrics (i.e., JudgeLM) and a human evaluation. Results show that our framework outperforms standard LLM baselines and competitive approach, on both assessments. The resulting framework and the knowledge base pave the way for studying trustworthy and sound counter-speech generation, in hate speech and beyond. <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic\" style=\"--ltx-fg-color:#FF0000;\">Warning<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_medium\">: this paper contains explicit examples some readers may find offensive.</span></span></p>\n\n",

The system is presented for research purposes only and is not intended for unsupervised deployment.\nWe further recognize that the perceived effectiveness and appropriateness of CS depend on social and cultural context.
