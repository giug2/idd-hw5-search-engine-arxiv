In this paper, we introduce the SAFE (Synthetic Audio Forensics Evaluation) Challenge, a fully blind evaluation framework designed to benchmark detection models across progressively harder scenarios: raw synthetic speech, processed audio (e.g., compression, resampling), and laundered audio intended to evade forensic analysis. The SAFE challenge consisted of a total of 90 hours of audio and 21,000 audio samples split across 21 different real sources and 17 different TTS models and 3 tasks. We present the challenge, evaluation design and tasks, dataset details, and initial insights into the strengths and limitations of current approaches, offering a foundation for advancing synthetic audio detection research.

First, the tasks were intentionally structured to increase in difficulty, ensuring a progression from basic detection to more challenging, real-world adversarial scenarios. To achieve this difficulty gradient, we chose task objectives and underlying datasets that represent semantically different, and increasingly more complicated and adversarial, problem spaces. The first task consisted of raw synthetically generated audio; the second task consisted of synthetically generated audio compressed in differing ways, adding simulated complexity of real-world conditions; and the third task consisted of an adversarial approach that attempted to fool participant detectors by adding various background noise, which we refer to as laundering attacks. Second, we designed the difficulty of the first task to be balanced on two baseline audio detectors developed under the DARPA SemaFor program&#160;<cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite\">[<a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03387v2#bib.bib7\" title=\"\">7</a>]</cite>.

In this paper, we introduce the SAFE (Synthetic Audio Forensics Evaluation) Challenge, a fully blind evaluation framework designed to benchmark detection models across progressively harder scenarios: raw synthetic speech, processed audio (e.g., compression, resampling), and laundered audio intended to evade forensic analysis. The SAFE challenge consisted of a total of 90 hours of audio and 21,000 audio samples split across 21 different real sources and 17 different TTS models and 3 tasks. We present the challenge, evaluation design and tasks, dataset details, and initial insights into the strengths and limitations of current approaches, offering a foundation for advancing synthetic audio detection research.

First, the tasks were intentionally structured to increase in difficulty, ensuring a progression from basic detection to more challenging, real-world adversarial scenarios.

The first task consisted of raw synthetically generated audio; the second task consisted of synthetically generated audio compressed in differing ways, adding simulated complexity of real-world conditions; and the third task consisted of an adversarial approach that attempted to fool participant detectors by adding various background noise, which we refer to as laundering attacks.

Here, we used our existing benchmark detectors to select a set of operations that maximally decreased the detection rate. These include adding real-life car background noise, applying reverb, and recording sound played over the air. While all laundering techniques were effective on their own, the combination of all three was the most difficult to detect. Even on its own, recording synthetic audio being played over the air resulted in significant degradation.

In this paper, we introduce the SAFE (Synthetic Audio Forensics Evaluation) Challenge, a fully blind evaluation framework designed to benchmark detection models across progressively harder scenarios: raw synthetic speech, processed audio (e.g., compression, resampling), and laundered audio intended to evade forensic analysis. The SAFE challenge consisted of a total of 90 hours of audio and 21,000 audio samples split across 21 different real sources and 17 different TTS models and 3 tasks. We present the challenge, evaluation design and tasks, dataset details, and initial insights into the strengths and limitations of current approaches, offering a foundation for advancing synthetic audio detection research.

First, the tasks were intentionally structured to increase in difficulty, ensuring a progression from basic detection to more challenging, real-world adversarial scenarios. To achieve this difficulty gradient, we chose task objectives and underlying datasets that represent semantically different, and increasingly more complicated and adversarial, problem spaces. The first task consisted of raw synthetically generated audio; the second task consisted of synthetically generated audio compressed in differing ways, adding simulated complexity of real-world conditions; and the third task consisted of an adversarial approach that attempted to fool participant detectors by adding various background noise, which we refer to as laundering attacks.

In this paper, we introduce the SAFE (Synthetic Audio Forensics Evaluation) Challenge, a fully blind evaluation framework designed to benchmark detection models across progressively harder scenarios: raw synthetic speech, processed audio (e.g., compression, resampling), and laundered audio intended to evade forensic analysis. The SAFE challenge consisted of a total of 90 hours of audio and 21,000 audio samples split across 21 different real sources and 17 different TTS models and 3 tasks.

The first task consisted of raw synthetically generated audio; the second task consisted of synthetically generated audio compressed in differing ways, adding simulated complexity of real-world conditions; and the third task consisted of an adversarial approach that attempted to fool participant detectors by adding various background noise, which we refer to as laundering attacks.

These observations point to a potential and easily exploitable vulnerability in the detection of synthetic audio using current methods.</p>\n\n",

SAFE emphasizes critical research areas that include robustness across diverse data sources (including both generated and real audio), resilience to emerging laundering techniques, and computational efficiency for practical deployment considerations. SAFE aims to provide a rigorous, blind evaluation framework that targets three key areas of forensic analysis: detection of 1) raw synthetic speech, 2) compressed and resampled synthetic audio, and 3) audio subjected to laundering attacks intended to obfuscate synthetic origins. By benchmarking performance across a diverse, balanced set of real and synthetic sources under controlled computational conditions, SAFE aimed to evaluate not only detection accuracy, but also generalization across unseen sources and resilience to realistic adversarial conditions.\nThis competition makes the following key contributions:</p>\n\n",

First, the tasks were intentionally structured to increase in difficulty, ensuring a progression from basic detection to more challenging, real-world adversarial scenarios. To achieve this difficulty gradient, we chose task objectives and underlying datasets that represent semantically different, and increasingly more complicated and adversarial, problem spaces. The first task consisted of raw synthetically generated audio; the second task consisted of synthetically generated audio compressed in differing ways, adding simulated complexity of real-world conditions; and the third task consisted of an adversarial approach that attempted to fool participant detectors by adding various background noise, which we refer to as laundering attacks. Second, we designed the difficulty of the first task to be balanced on two baseline audio detectors developed under the DARPA SemaFor program&#160;<cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite\">[<a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03387v2#bib.bib7\" title=\"\">7</a>]</cite>.

In this paper, we introduce the SAFE (Synthetic Audio Forensics Evaluation) Challenge, a fully blind evaluation framework designed to benchmark detection models across progressively harder scenarios: raw synthetic speech, processed audio (e.g., compression, resampling), and laundered audio intended to evade forensic analysis. The SAFE challenge consisted of a total of 90 hours of audio and 21,000 audio samples split across 21 different real sources and 17 different TTS models and 3 tasks. We present the challenge, evaluation design and tasks, dataset details, and initial insights into the strengths and limitations of current approaches, offering a foundation for advancing synthetic audio detection research.

These challenges primarily focused on speaker verification, i.e. determining whether speech was produced by a known speaker or by using a synthetic audio system to spoof that speaker, as opposed to detecting synthetic audio from an unknown source.\nSeveral synthetic audio detectors &#160;<cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite\">[<a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03387v2#bib.bib7\" title=\"\">7</a>]</cite> were also developed during the DARPA Semantic Forensics (SemaFor) program, however, evaluations within this program were limited to program performers and were not accessible to the wider research community. Finally, in 2022, the IEEE Signal Processing Cup hosted a competition that tasked participants with synthetic audio attribution&#160;<cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite\">[<a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03387v2#bib.bib8\" title=\"\">8</a>]</cite>, but its primary audience was undergraduate students, limiting its impact on the broader research field.\nIn contrast, the SAFE competition was open to the full research community and pursued two main objectives: (1) to catalyze the development of robust synthetic audio detection systems capable of generalizing across unknown speakers, and (2) to identify persistent challenges and performance gaps in current detection methodologies.</p>\n\n",

First, the tasks were intentionally structured to increase in difficulty, ensuring a progression from basic detection to more challenging, real-world adversarial scenarios. To achieve this difficulty gradient, we chose task objectives and underlying datasets that represent semantically different, and increasingly more complicated and adversarial, problem spaces. The first task consisted of raw synthetically generated audio; the second task consisted of synthetically generated audio compressed in differing ways, adding simulated complexity of real-world conditions; and the third task consisted of an adversarial approach that attempted to fool participant detectors by adding various background noise, which we refer to as laundering attacks. Second, we designed the difficulty of the first task to be balanced on two baseline audio detectors developed under the DARPA SemaFor program&#160;<cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite\">[<a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2510.03387v2#bib.bib7\" title=\"\">7</a>]</cite>.

In this paper, we introduce the SAFE (Synthetic Audio Forensics Evaluation) Challenge, a fully blind evaluation framework designed to benchmark detection models across progressively harder scenarios: raw synthetic speech, processed audio (e.g., compression, resampling), and laundered audio intended to evade forensic analysis. The SAFE challenge consisted of a total of 90 hours of audio and 21,000 audio samples split across 21 different real sources and 17 different TTS models and 3 tasks. We present the challenge, evaluation design and tasks, dataset details, and initial insights into the strengths and limitations of current approaches, offering a foundation for advancing synthetic audio detection research.

First, the tasks were intentionally structured to increase in difficulty, ensuring a progression from basic detection to more challenging, real-world adversarial scenarios. To achieve this difficulty gradient, we chose task objectives and underlying datasets that represent semantically different, and increasingly more complicated and adversarial, problem spaces. The first task consisted of raw synthetically generated audio; the second task consisted of synthetically generated audio compressed in differing ways, adding simulated complexity of real-world conditions; and the third task consisted of an adversarial approach that attempted to fool participant detectors by adding various background noise, which we refer to as laundering attacks.

In this paper, we introduce the SAFE (Synthetic Audio Forensics Evaluation) Challenge, a fully blind evaluation framework designed to benchmark detection models across progressively harder scenarios: raw synthetic speech, processed audio (e.g., compression, resampling), and laundered audio intended to evade forensic analysis. The SAFE challenge consisted of a total of 90 hours of audio and 21,000 audio samples split across 21 different real sources and 17 different TTS models and 3 tasks. We present the challenge, evaluation design and tasks, dataset details, and initial insights into the strengths and limitations of current approaches, offering a foundation for advancing synthetic audio detection research.

Furthermore, such techniques could be used to intentionally avoid detection by forensic systems, as our Task&#160;3 resutls show.</p>\n\n",

ISSF used a self-supervised-learning front-end for feature extraction and an Aasist backend for classification. DMF, like JAI, used RawNet2 as part of their detector pipeline. DMF tested various combinations of label noise learning (LNL), inter-sample distillation (ISD) and SSI (self-supervised initialization) as the input into the RawNet2 framework.\nISPL, the highest performer, used a mixture-of-experts approach (MOE) for their detector. Specifically, they used a mixture of implicitly localized experts (MILE) where each expert has a different model architecture, but the training data is the same across experts.
