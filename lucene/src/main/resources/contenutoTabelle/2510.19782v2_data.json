Starting from a multilingual base model, we: (i) perform continued pre-training (CPT) on unlabeled code-mixed text to obtain an adapted checkpoint, (ii) merge checkpoint with the base model, and (iii) fine-tune&#160;(FT) on the downstream task data. We evaluate our approach for sentence classification (sentiment and hate speech) task in English-Hindi (En-Hi) and English-Spanish (En-Es) using XLM-R and Llama-3.2-1B models.

Zero-/few-shot prompting with larger LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.3-70B) lags behind fine-tuned and merged checkpoints, underscoring limits of in-context learning for code-mixed inputs. We further test cross-pair transfer by training on En&#8211;Hi and evaluating on En&#8211;Ta and En&#8211;Ml: merged checkpoints transfer more strongly than monolingual-English baselines (e.g., TV/TIES variants reaching 0.65&#8211;0.68 <math alttext=\"F_{1}\" class=\"ltx_Math\" display=\"inline\" id=\"m5\" intent=\":literal\"><semantics><msub><mi>F</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">F_{1}</annotation></semantics></math> vs. 0.61&#8211;0.63 for full fine-tuning), suggesting that code-mixed knowledge is a more reliable substrate for low-resource pairs.

We further test cross-pair transfer by training on En&#8211;Hi and evaluating on En&#8211;Ta and En&#8211;Ml: merged checkpoints transfer more strongly than monolingual-English baselines (e.g., TV/TIES variants reaching 0.65&#8211;0.68 <math alttext=\"F_{1}\" class=\"ltx_Math\" display=\"inline\" id=\"m5\" intent=\":literal\"><semantics><msub><mi>F</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">F_{1}</annotation></semantics></math> vs. 0.61&#8211;0.63 for full fine-tuning), suggesting that code-mixed knowledge is a more reliable substrate for low-resource pairs.

Zero-/few-shot prompting with larger LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.3-70B) lags behind fine-tuned and merged checkpoints, underscoring limits of in-context learning for code-mixed inputs. We further test cross-pair transfer by training on En&#8211;Hi and evaluating on En&#8211;Ta and En&#8211;Ml: merged checkpoints transfer more strongly than monolingual-English baselines (e.g., TV/TIES variants reaching 0.65&#8211;0.68 <math alttext=\"F_{1}\" class=\"ltx_Math\" display=\"inline\" id=\"m5\" intent=\":literal\"><semantics><msub><mi>F</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">F_{1}</annotation></semantics></math> vs. 0.61&#8211;0.63 for full fine-tuning), suggesting that code-mixed knowledge is a more reliable substrate for low-resource pairs.

Zero-/few-shot prompting with larger LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.3-70B) lags behind fine-tuned and merged checkpoints, underscoring limits of in-context learning for code-mixed inputs. We further test cross-pair transfer by training on En&#8211;Hi and evaluating on En&#8211;Ta and En&#8211;Ml: merged checkpoints transfer more strongly than monolingual-English baselines (e.g., TV/TIES variants reaching 0.65&#8211;0.68 <math alttext=\"F_{1}\" class=\"ltx_Math\" display=\"inline\" id=\"m5\" intent=\":literal\"><semantics><msub><mi>F</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">F_{1}</annotation></semantics></math> vs. 0.61&#8211;0.63 for full fine-tuning), suggesting that code-mixed knowledge is a more reliable substrate for low-resource pairs.

Starting from a multilingual base model, we: (i) perform continued pre-training (CPT) on unlabeled code-mixed text to obtain an adapted checkpoint, (ii) merge checkpoint with the base model, and (iii) fine-tune&#160;(FT) on the downstream task data. We evaluate our approach for sentence classification (sentiment and hate speech) task in English-Hindi (En-Hi) and English-Spanish (En-Es) using XLM-R and Llama-3.2-1B models.

Zero-/few-shot prompting with larger LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.3-70B) lags behind fine-tuned and merged checkpoints, underscoring limits of in-context learning for code-mixed inputs. We further test cross-pair transfer by training on En&#8211;Hi and evaluating on En&#8211;Ta and En&#8211;Ml: merged checkpoints transfer more strongly than monolingual-English baselines (e.g., TV/TIES variants reaching 0.65&#8211;0.68 <math alttext=\"F_{1}\" class=\"ltx_Math\" display=\"inline\" id=\"m5\" intent=\":literal\"><semantics><msub><mi>F</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">F_{1}</annotation></semantics></math> vs. 0.61&#8211;0.63 for full fine-tuning), suggesting that code-mixed knowledge is a more reliable substrate for low-resource pairs. We conclude with adaptation recipes matched to common data regimes (labeled only; labeled+unlabeled; transfer-only) and discuss limitations and scaling considerations for broader tasks and larger models.</p>\n\n",
