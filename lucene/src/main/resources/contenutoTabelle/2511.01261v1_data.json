Current pipelines often use audio large language models (ALLMs) as zero-shot judges, which miss paralinguistic cues, collapse multiple aspects into coarse scores, and rely on synthetic speech references that fail to reflect real-world roles. We present <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">Speech-DRAME</span>, a unified framework that contributes at three levels: (i) <em class=\"ltx_emph ltx_font_italic\">Speech-DRAME-EvalBench</em>, an evaluation benchmark with bilingual human-annotated data and protocols for training and testing speech evaluation models&#160;(SEMs), (ii) <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter\">DRAME-Eval</span>, a fine-tuned evaluation model, which substantially outperforms zero-shot and few-shot ALLMs, and (iii) <em class=\"ltx_emph ltx_font_italic\">Speech-DRAME-RoleBench</em>, a speech role-play benchmark that leverages <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter\">DRAME-Eval</span> as an automatic judge to compare speech foundation models (SFMs).

Incorporating multilingual and cross-cultural datasets will enhance generality and fairness. On the modeling side, exploring hybrid evaluation strategies that combine discrete rubrics with continuous perceptual signals (e.g., prosody embeddings or affective measures) may better bridge the gap between automatic and human judgments.

Several end-to-end models, such as <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter\">GLM4-Voice</span> and <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter\">Qwen2.5Omni</span>, reach average scores of 3.24, matching or even exceeding the best cascaded pipelines. Importantly, realism scores are more evenly distributed across prosodic, emotional, character, and contextual dimensions, with most models clustering between 2.9&#8211;3.2. This convergence reflects the difficulty of realism-style evaluation: since the data preparation emphasized contrast with authentic human speech, models are judged under similar conditions, leading to smaller observed gaps.</p>\n\n"

Extending role-play to speech captures prosody, emotion, and delivery, but also poses new evaluation challenges. Current pipelines often use audio large language models (ALLMs) as zero-shot judges, which miss paralinguistic cues, collapse multiple aspects into coarse scores, and rely on synthetic speech references that fail to reflect real-world roles. We present <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">Speech-DRAME</span>, a unified framework that contributes at three levels: (i) <em class=\"ltx_emph ltx_font_italic\">Speech-DRAME-EvalBench</em>, an evaluation benchmark with bilingual human-annotated data and protocols for training and testing speech evaluation models&#160;(SEMs), (ii) <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter\">DRAME-Eval</span>, a fine-tuned evaluation model, which substantially outperforms zero-shot and few-shot ALLMs, and (iii) <em class=\"ltx_emph ltx_font_italic\">Speech-DRAME-RoleBench</em>, a speech role-play benchmark that leverages <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter\">DRAME-Eval</span> as an automatic judge to compare speech foundation models (SFMs). Speech-DRAME distinguishes between two complementary evaluation strategies: <em class=\"ltx_emph ltx_font_italic\">Archetype Evaluation</em>, a top-down approach measuring adherence to broad role archetypes, and <em class=\"ltx_emph ltx_font_italic\">Realism Evaluation</em>, a bottom-up approach grounded in real human speech that emphasizes nuanced role quality. Compared to zero-shot ALLM judges, <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter\">DRAME-Eval</span> achieves stronger agreement with human ratings (Pearson correlation from 0.480 to 0.629 in archetypes, and 0.390 to 0.625 in realism). By integrating transparent benchmark resources, modeling approaches, and system-level evaluation, Speech-DRAME provides the first comprehensive, reproducible foundation for assessing spoken role-play.</p>\n\n",

Extending role-play to speech captures prosody, emotion, and delivery, but also poses new evaluation challenges. Current pipelines often use audio large language models (ALLMs) as zero-shot judges, which miss paralinguistic cues, collapse multiple aspects into coarse scores, and rely on synthetic speech references that fail to reflect real-world roles. We present <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">Speech-DRAME</span>, a unified framework that contributes at three levels: (i) <em class=\"ltx_emph ltx_font_italic\">Speech-DRAME-EvalBench</em>, an evaluation benchmark with bilingual human-annotated data and protocols for training and testing speech evaluation models&#160;(SEMs), (ii) <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter\">DRAME-Eval</span>, a fine-tuned evaluation model, which substantially outperforms zero-shot and few-shot ALLMs, and (iii) <em class=\"ltx_emph ltx_font_italic\">Speech-DRAME-RoleBench</em>, a speech role-play benchmark that leverages <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter\">DRAME-Eval</span> as an automatic judge to compare speech foundation models (SFMs).

Extending role-play to speech captures prosody, emotion, and delivery, but also poses new evaluation challenges. Current pipelines often use audio large language models (ALLMs) as zero-shot judges, which miss paralinguistic cues, collapse multiple aspects into coarse scores, and rely on synthetic speech references that fail to reflect real-world roles. We present <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">Speech-DRAME</span>, a unified framework that contributes at three levels: (i) <em class=\"ltx_emph ltx_font_italic\">Speech-DRAME-EvalBench</em>, an evaluation benchmark with bilingual human-annotated data and protocols for training and testing speech evaluation models&#160;(SEMs), (ii) <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter\">DRAME-Eval</span>, a fine-tuned evaluation model, which substantially outperforms zero-shot and few-shot ALLMs, and (iii) <em class=\"ltx_emph ltx_font_italic\">Speech-DRAME-RoleBench</em>, a speech role-play benchmark that leverages <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter\">DRAME-Eval</span> as an automatic judge to compare speech foundation models (SFMs). Speech-DRAME distinguishes between two complementary evaluation strategies: <em class=\"ltx_emph ltx_font_italic\">Archetype Evaluation</em>, a top-down approach measuring adherence to broad role archetypes, and <em class=\"ltx_emph ltx_font_italic\">Realism Evaluation</em>, a bottom-up approach grounded in real human speech that emphasizes nuanced role quality. Compared to zero-shot ALLM judges, <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter\">DRAME-Eval</span> achieves stronger agreement with human ratings (Pearson correlation from 0.480 to 0.629 in archetypes, and 0.390 to 0.625 in realism).

Extending role-play to speech captures prosody, emotion, and delivery, but also poses new evaluation challenges. Current pipelines often use audio large language models (ALLMs) as zero-shot judges, which miss paralinguistic cues, collapse multiple aspects into coarse scores, and rely on synthetic speech references that fail to reflect real-world roles. We present <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">Speech-DRAME</span>, a unified framework that contributes at three levels: (i) <em class=\"ltx_emph ltx_font_italic\">Speech-DRAME-EvalBench</em>, an evaluation benchmark with bilingual human-annotated data and protocols for training and testing speech evaluation models&#160;(SEMs), (ii) <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter\">DRAME-Eval</span>, a fine-tuned evaluation model, which substantially outperforms zero-shot and few-shot ALLMs, and (iii) <em class=\"ltx_emph ltx_font_italic\">Speech-DRAME-RoleBench</em>, a speech role-play benchmark that leverages <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter\">DRAME-Eval</span> as an automatic judge to compare speech foundation models (SFMs). Speech-DRAME distinguishes between two complementary evaluation strategies: <em class=\"ltx_emph ltx_font_italic\">Archetype Evaluation</em>, a top-down approach measuring adherence to broad role archetypes, and <em class=\"ltx_emph ltx_font_italic\">Realism Evaluation</em>, a bottom-up approach grounded in real human speech that emphasizes nuanced role quality. Compared to zero-shot ALLM judges, <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter\">DRAME-Eval</span> achieves stronger agreement with human ratings (Pearson correlation from 0.480 to 0.629 in archetypes, and 0.390 to 0.625 in realism). By integrating transparent benchmark resources, modeling approaches, and system-level evaluation, Speech-DRAME provides the first comprehensive, reproducible foundation for assessing spoken role-play.</p>\n\n",

In contrast, for open-source models, we observed that their instruction-following ability is relatively weak. To mitigate this, we prompt them to predict one dimension at a time rather than all dimensions jointly. Specifically, for each metric, after showing the rubric prompt, we request completion in a fixed template and extract the probability distribution over the discrete tokens <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter\">[1]</span>&#8211;<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter\">[5]</span>.

For example, Mandarin raters tend to reward delivery styles that align with culturally expected prosody and politeness strategies, while English raters prioritize spontaneity and naturalness. These discrepancies parallel the findings of the singing voice conversion challenge (SVCC2023) from <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet\">Huang et&#160;al.

The annotation groups for the two languages differed in their linguistic backgrounds and cultural interpretations, which leads to systematic differences in scoring. Our bilingual pilot further confirmed that annotators often interpret role-play appropriateness and expressiveness differently depending on their cultural frame of reference. For example, Mandarin raters tend to reward delivery styles that align with culturally expected prosody and politeness strategies, while English raters prioritize spontaneity and naturalness. These discrepancies parallel the findings of the singing voice conversion challenge (SVCC2023) from <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet\">Huang et&#160;al. (<a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2511.01261v1#bib.bib31\" title=\"\">2023</a>)</cite>, where native and non-native listeners provided significantly different ratings for the same samples, particularly for naturalness and speaker similarity.

Extending role-play to speech captures prosody, emotion, and delivery, but also poses new evaluation challenges. Current pipelines often use audio large language models (ALLMs) as zero-shot judges, which miss paralinguistic cues, collapse multiple aspects into coarse scores, and rely on synthetic speech references that fail to reflect real-world roles. We present <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">Speech-DRAME</span>, a unified framework that contributes at three levels: (i) <em class=\"ltx_emph ltx_font_italic\">Speech-DRAME-EvalBench</em>, an evaluation benchmark with bilingual human-annotated data and protocols for training and testing speech evaluation models&#160;(SEMs), (ii) <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter\">DRAME-Eval</span>, a fine-tuned evaluation model, which substantially outperforms zero-shot and few-shot ALLMs, and (iii) <em class=\"ltx_emph ltx_font_italic\">Speech-DRAME-RoleBench</em>, a speech role-play benchmark that leverages <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter\">DRAME-Eval</span> as an automatic judge to compare speech foundation models (SFMs).

Compared to zero-shot ALLM judges, <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter\">DRAME-Eval</span> achieves stronger agreement with human ratings (Pearson correlation from 0.480 to 0.629 in archetypes, and 0.390 to 0.625 in realism).

However, multi-turn extensions that capture narrative progression, long-term consistency, and dynamic emotion shifts remain a natural next step. Incorporating multilingual and cross-cultural datasets will enhance generality and fairness. On the modeling side, exploring hybrid evaluation strategies that combine discrete rubrics with continuous perceptual signals (e.g., prosody embeddings or affective measures) may better bridge the gap between automatic and human judgments. Finally, integrating Speech-DRAME into reinforcement learning pipelines as a reward model could help drive the next generation of expressive, human-aligned speech role-play systems.</p>\n\n",

Extending role-play to speech captures prosody, emotion, and delivery, but also poses new evaluation challenges. Current pipelines often use audio large language models (ALLMs) as zero-shot judges, which miss paralinguistic cues, collapse multiple aspects into coarse scores, and rely on synthetic speech references that fail to reflect real-world roles. We present <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">Speech-DRAME</span>, a unified framework that contributes at three levels: (i) <em class=\"ltx_emph ltx_font_italic\">Speech-DRAME-EvalBench</em>, an evaluation benchmark with bilingual human-annotated data and protocols for training and testing speech evaluation models&#160;(SEMs), (ii) <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter\">DRAME-Eval</span>, a fine-tuned evaluation model, which substantially outperforms zero-shot and few-shot ALLMs, and (iii) <em class=\"ltx_emph ltx_font_italic\">Speech-DRAME-RoleBench</em>, a speech role-play benchmark that leverages <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter\">DRAME-Eval</span> as an automatic judge to compare speech foundation models (SFMs).

The annotation groups for the two languages differed in their linguistic backgrounds and cultural interpretations, which leads to systematic differences in scoring. Our bilingual pilot further confirmed that annotators often interpret role-play appropriateness and expressiveness differently depending on their cultural frame of reference. For example, Mandarin raters tend to reward delivery styles that align with culturally expected prosody and politeness strategies, while English raters prioritize spontaneity and naturalness. These discrepancies parallel the findings of the singing voice conversion challenge (SVCC2023) from <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet\">Huang et&#160;al.

Archetype evaluation inevitably relies on simplified stereotypes, which can overlook subtler paralinguistic and contextual cues. Realism evaluation, though richer, still struggles with domain mismatch between synthetic data and real human recordings, as evidenced by the performance drop observed in the real-recording test set. This highlights the persistent gap between benchmark-driven evaluation and real-world variability in speech role-play.</p>\n\n",

On the modeling side, exploring hybrid evaluation strategies that combine discrete rubrics with continuous perceptual signals (e.g., prosody embeddings or affective measures) may better bridge the gap between automatic and human judgments.

Extending role-play to speech captures prosody, emotion, and delivery, but also poses new evaluation challenges. Current pipelines often use audio large language models (ALLMs) as zero-shot judges, which miss paralinguistic cues, collapse multiple aspects into coarse scores, and rely on synthetic speech references that fail to reflect real-world roles. We present <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">Speech-DRAME</span>, a unified framework that contributes at three levels: (i) <em class=\"ltx_emph ltx_font_italic\">Speech-DRAME-EvalBench</em>, an evaluation benchmark with bilingual human-annotated data and protocols for training and testing speech evaluation models&#160;(SEMs), (ii) <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter\">DRAME-Eval</span>, a fine-tuned evaluation model, which substantially outperforms zero-shot and few-shot ALLMs, and (iii) <em class=\"ltx_emph ltx_font_italic\">Speech-DRAME-RoleBench</em>, a speech role-play benchmark that leverages <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter\">DRAME-Eval</span> as an automatic judge to compare speech foundation models (SFMs).

Extending role-play to speech captures prosody, emotion, and delivery, but also poses new evaluation challenges. Current pipelines often use audio large language models (ALLMs) as zero-shot judges, which miss paralinguistic cues, collapse multiple aspects into coarse scores, and rely on synthetic speech references that fail to reflect real-world roles. We present <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">Speech-DRAME</span>, a unified framework that contributes at three levels: (i) <em class=\"ltx_emph ltx_font_italic\">Speech-DRAME-EvalBench</em>, an evaluation benchmark with bilingual human-annotated data and protocols for training and testing speech evaluation models&#160;(SEMs), (ii) <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter\">DRAME-Eval</span>, a fine-tuned evaluation model, which substantially outperforms zero-shot and few-shot ALLMs, and (iii) <em class=\"ltx_emph ltx_font_italic\">Speech-DRAME-RoleBench</em>, a speech role-play benchmark that leverages <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter\">DRAME-Eval</span> as an automatic judge to compare speech foundation models (SFMs).

Compared to zero-shot ALLM judges, <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter\">DRAME-Eval</span> achieves stronger agreement with human ratings (Pearson correlation from 0.480 to 0.629 in archetypes, and 0.390 to 0.625 in realism).
