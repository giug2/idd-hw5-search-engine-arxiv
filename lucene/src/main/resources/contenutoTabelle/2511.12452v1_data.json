Their contribution is particularly exemplified by the adoption of an audio-driven annotation paradigm, which enables the collection of large-scale, high-quality 2D image data without relying on proprietary VLM distillation.\nHowever, PixMo has not released an open-source annotation platform, which limits the community&#8217;s ability to expand the dataset in specific domain. Our open-source online platform, DenseAnnotate, distinguishes itself by extending this dense captioning approach into fundamentally new and challenging domains. Crucially, while PixMo focuses on 2D imagery through separate tasks (PixMo-Cap for dense captioning and PixMo-Points for pointing), DenseAnnotate introduces a unified online annotation platform that enables the simultaneous collection of dense captions and pointing annotations within a single interface, and further extends dense captioning capabilities to complex 3D assets. By constructing our MLDC-3D dataset, we directly address the critical lack of scene-level high-quality data required for models dedicated to 3D understanding. Furthermore, DenseAnnotate places a specialized emphasis on capturing cultural nuances through our MLDC-MC dataset. This collection leverages native-language annotators to acquire detailed and culturally aligned descriptions, resulting in significantly longer captions, thus ensuring a depth of linguistic and cultural representation that complements existing open MLLMs efforts.</p>\n\n",

Because the answers are based on multiple transcripts, they are more comprehensive and reliable. Stage 2 converts OEQA pairs into multiple-choice questions using GPT-4o, leveraging question-specific strategies. For example, to ensure high-quality distractors, we sample them from cross-question data.

Their contribution is particularly exemplified by the adoption of an audio-driven annotation paradigm, which enables the collection of large-scale, high-quality 2D image data without relying on proprietary VLM distillation.\nHowever, PixMo has not released an open-source annotation platform, which limits the community&#8217;s ability to expand the dataset in specific domain. Our open-source online platform, DenseAnnotate, distinguishes itself by extending this dense captioning approach into fundamentally new and challenging domains. Crucially, while PixMo focuses on 2D imagery through separate tasks (PixMo-Cap for dense captioning and PixMo-Points for pointing), DenseAnnotate introduces a unified online annotation platform that enables the simultaneous collection of dense captions and pointing annotations within a single interface, and further extends dense captioning capabilities to complex 3D assets. By constructing our MLDC-3D dataset, we directly address the critical lack of scene-level high-quality data required for models dedicated to 3D understanding. Furthermore, DenseAnnotate places a specialized emphasis on capturing cultural nuances through our MLDC-MC dataset. This collection leverages native-language annotators to acquire detailed and culturally aligned descriptions, resulting in significantly longer captions, thus ensuring a depth of linguistic and cultural representation that complements existing open MLLMs efforts.</p>\n\n",

In the second stage, human annotators interact with the data through multiple operations&#8212;such as pointing and naming for 2D images, and zooming, panning, and freely rotating for 3D objects or scenes. In the latter case, annotators can also isolate and closely examine individual objects within the scene before producing their audio descriptions. To make the captions dense enough, we set the minimum recording times as follows: 60 seconds for images or 3D scenes, and 20 seconds for 3D objects. The recordings are transcribed into raw captions, and annotators can edit typos. We recruit multiple annotators to label each of the images or 3D assets. In the last stage, multiple raw captions are summarized using LLMs to produce high-quality, dense captions, thereby enhancing both the accuracy and richness of the annotations.</p>\n\n",

For 3D scene tasks, the system implements a mandatory sequential workflow: individual object annotations (annotation step 1) must be completed first, then the system unlocks the scene-level recording interface (annotation step 2). This approach not only enables annotators to become familiar with the objects in the scene first, but also increases the density of the overall description. Temporal constraints enforce minimum recording durations (20 seconds for individual objects, 60 seconds for scenes or images) with automatic 3-minute cutoffs to balance annotation depth and annotator fatigue. Also, we developed a dual-transcript preservation mechanism that stores both the automatically generated transcription from OpenAI&#8217;s Whisper API and the user-edited version, enabling us to detect excessive discrepancies between them and identify cases where annotators might have copied the VLMs&#8217; output instead of recording manually.

Because the answers are based on multiple transcripts, they are more comprehensive and reliable. Stage 2 converts OEQA pairs into multiple-choice questions using GPT-4o, leveraging question-specific strategies. For example, to ensure high-quality distractors, we sample them from cross-question data.

Their contribution is particularly exemplified by the adoption of an audio-driven annotation paradigm, which enables the collection of large-scale, high-quality 2D image data without relying on proprietary VLM distillation.\nHowever, PixMo has not released an open-source annotation platform, which limits the community&#8217;s ability to expand the dataset in specific domain. Our open-source online platform, DenseAnnotate, distinguishes itself by extending this dense captioning approach into fundamentally new and challenging domains. Crucially, while PixMo focuses on 2D imagery through separate tasks (PixMo-Cap for dense captioning and PixMo-Points for pointing), DenseAnnotate introduces a unified online annotation platform that enables the simultaneous collection of dense captions and pointing annotations within a single interface, and further extends dense captioning capabilities to complex 3D assets. By constructing our MLDC-3D dataset, we directly address the critical lack of scene-level high-quality data required for models dedicated to 3D understanding. Furthermore, DenseAnnotate places a specialized emphasis on capturing cultural nuances through our MLDC-MC dataset. This collection leverages native-language annotators to acquire detailed and culturally aligned descriptions, resulting in significantly longer captions, thus ensuring a depth of linguistic and cultural representation that complements existing open MLLMs efforts.</p>\n\n",

In the latter case, annotators can also isolate and closely examine individual objects within the scene before producing their audio descriptions. To make the captions dense enough, we set the minimum recording times as follows: 60 seconds for images or 3D scenes, and 20 seconds for 3D objects. The recordings are transcribed into raw captions, and annotators can edit typos. We recruit multiple annotators to label each of the images or 3D assets. In the last stage, multiple raw captions are summarized using LLMs to produce high-quality, dense captions, thereby enhancing both the accuracy and richness of the annotations.</p>\n\n",

For 2D image tasks, the platform enforces that annotators mark at least five objects with native-language labels. For 3D scene tasks, the system implements a mandatory sequential workflow: individual object annotations (annotation step 1) must be completed first, then the system unlocks the scene-level recording interface (annotation step 2). This approach not only enables annotators to become familiar with the objects in the scene first, but also increases the density of the overall description. Temporal constraints enforce minimum recording durations (20 seconds for individual objects, 60 seconds for scenes or images) with automatic 3-minute cutoffs to balance annotation depth and annotator fatigue. Also, we developed a dual-transcript preservation mechanism that stores both the automatically generated transcription from OpenAI&#8217;s Whisper API and the user-edited version, enabling us to detect excessive discrepancies between them and identify cases where annotators might have copied the VLMs&#8217; output instead of recording manually. At last, we use GPT-4o to summarize multiple transcriptions into one final caption to improve the text quality of the transcriptions.</p>\n\n",

This finding suggests that the pre-trained model, despite being trained on 660K brief description data and 70K complex instruction data, lacks the training distribution alignment necessary for our scene-level tasks. This inherent limitation underscores the importance of our novel dataset, which is specifically designed to drive advancements in scene-level 3D understanding and complex reasoning. We train the model with one sixty-fourth of the training data to provide basic scene capacity and use it as the baseline.</p>\n\n",

Their contribution is particularly exemplified by the adoption of an audio-driven annotation paradigm, which enables the collection of large-scale, high-quality 2D image data without relying on proprietary VLM distillation.\nHowever, PixMo has not released an open-source annotation platform, which limits the community&#8217;s ability to expand the dataset in specific domain. Our open-source online platform, DenseAnnotate, distinguishes itself by extending this dense captioning approach into fundamentally new and challenging domains. Crucially, while PixMo focuses on 2D imagery through separate tasks (PixMo-Cap for dense captioning and PixMo-Points for pointing), DenseAnnotate introduces a unified online annotation platform that enables the simultaneous collection of dense captions and pointing annotations within a single interface, and further extends dense captioning capabilities to complex 3D assets. By constructing our MLDC-3D dataset, we directly address the critical lack of scene-level high-quality data required for models dedicated to 3D understanding. Furthermore, DenseAnnotate places a specialized emphasis on capturing cultural nuances through our MLDC-MC dataset. This collection leverages native-language annotators to acquire detailed and culturally aligned descriptions, resulting in significantly longer captions, thus ensuring a depth of linguistic and cultural representation that complements existing open MLLMs efforts.</p>\n\n",

In the second stage, human annotators interact with the data through multiple operations&#8212;such as pointing and naming for 2D images, and zooming, panning, and freely rotating for 3D objects or scenes. In the latter case, annotators can also isolate and closely examine individual objects within the scene before producing their audio descriptions. To make the captions dense enough, we set the minimum recording times as follows: 60 seconds for images or 3D scenes, and 20 seconds for 3D objects. The recordings are transcribed into raw captions, and annotators can edit typos. We recruit multiple annotators to label each of the images or 3D assets. In the last stage, multiple raw captions are summarized using LLMs to produce high-quality, dense captions, thereby enhancing both the accuracy and richness of the annotations.</p>\n\n",

For 3D scene tasks, the system implements a mandatory sequential workflow: individual object annotations (annotation step 1) must be completed first, then the system unlocks the scene-level recording interface (annotation step 2). This approach not only enables annotators to become familiar with the objects in the scene first, but also increases the density of the overall description. Temporal constraints enforce minimum recording durations (20 seconds for individual objects, 60 seconds for scenes or images) with automatic 3-minute cutoffs to balance annotation depth and annotator fatigue. Also, we developed a dual-transcript preservation mechanism that stores both the automatically generated transcription from OpenAI&#8217;s Whisper API and the user-edited version, enabling us to detect excessive discrepancies between them and identify cases where annotators might have copied the VLMs&#8217; output instead of recording manually.

Stage 2 converts OEQA pairs into multiple-choice questions using GPT-4o, leveraging question-specific strategies. For example, to ensure high-quality distractors, we sample them from cross-question data.

Their contribution is particularly exemplified by the adoption of an audio-driven annotation paradigm, which enables the collection of large-scale, high-quality 2D image data without relying on proprietary VLM distillation.\nHowever, PixMo has not released an open-source annotation platform, which limits the community&#8217;s ability to expand the dataset in specific domain. Our open-source online platform, DenseAnnotate, distinguishes itself by extending this dense captioning approach into fundamentally new and challenging domains. Crucially, while PixMo focuses on 2D imagery through separate tasks (PixMo-Cap for dense captioning and PixMo-Points for pointing), DenseAnnotate introduces a unified online annotation platform that enables the simultaneous collection of dense captions and pointing annotations within a single interface, and further extends dense captioning capabilities to complex 3D assets. By constructing our MLDC-3D dataset, we directly address the critical lack of scene-level high-quality data required for models dedicated to 3D understanding. Furthermore, DenseAnnotate places a specialized emphasis on capturing cultural nuances through our MLDC-MC dataset. This collection leverages native-language annotators to acquire detailed and culturally aligned descriptions, resulting in significantly longer captions, thus ensuring a depth of linguistic and cultural representation that complements existing open MLLMs efforts.</p>\n\n",

Their contribution is particularly exemplified by the adoption of an audio-driven annotation paradigm, which enables the collection of large-scale, high-quality 2D image data without relying on proprietary VLM distillation.\nHowever, PixMo has not released an open-source annotation platform, which limits the community&#8217;s ability to expand the dataset in specific domain. Our open-source online platform, DenseAnnotate, distinguishes itself by extending this dense captioning approach into fundamentally new and challenging domains. Crucially, while PixMo focuses on 2D imagery through separate tasks (PixMo-Cap for dense captioning and PixMo-Points for pointing), DenseAnnotate introduces a unified online annotation platform that enables the simultaneous collection of dense captions and pointing annotations within a single interface, and further extends dense captioning capabilities to complex 3D assets. By constructing our MLDC-3D dataset, we directly address the critical lack of scene-level high-quality data required for models dedicated to 3D understanding. Furthermore, DenseAnnotate places a specialized emphasis on capturing cultural nuances through our MLDC-MC dataset. This collection leverages native-language annotators to acquire detailed and culturally aligned descriptions, resulting in significantly longer captions, thus ensuring a depth of linguistic and cultural representation that complements existing open MLLMs efforts.</p>\n\n",

In the second stage, human annotators interact with the data through multiple operations&#8212;such as pointing and naming for 2D images, and zooming, panning, and freely rotating for 3D objects or scenes. In the latter case, annotators can also isolate and closely examine individual objects within the scene before producing their audio descriptions. To make the captions dense enough, we set the minimum recording times as follows: 60 seconds for images or 3D scenes, and 20 seconds for 3D objects. The recordings are transcribed into raw captions, and annotators can edit typos. We recruit multiple annotators to label each of the images or 3D assets. In the last stage, multiple raw captions are summarized using LLMs to produce high-quality, dense captions, thereby enhancing both the accuracy and richness of the annotations.</p>\n\n",

For 3D scene tasks, the system implements a mandatory sequential workflow: individual object annotations (annotation step 1) must be completed first, then the system unlocks the scene-level recording interface (annotation step 2). This approach not only enables annotators to become familiar with the objects in the scene first, but also increases the density of the overall description. Temporal constraints enforce minimum recording durations (20 seconds for individual objects, 60 seconds for scenes or images) with automatic 3-minute cutoffs to balance annotation depth and annotator fatigue. Also, we developed a dual-transcript preservation mechanism that stores both the automatically generated transcription from OpenAI&#8217;s Whisper API and the user-edited version, enabling us to detect excessive discrepancies between them and identify cases where annotators might have copied the VLMs&#8217; output instead of recording manually.

Their contribution is particularly exemplified by the adoption of an audio-driven annotation paradigm, which enables the collection of large-scale, high-quality 2D image data without relying on proprietary VLM distillation.\nHowever, PixMo has not released an open-source annotation platform, which limits the community&#8217;s ability to expand the dataset in specific domain. Our open-source online platform, DenseAnnotate, distinguishes itself by extending this dense captioning approach into fundamentally new and challenging domains. Crucially, while PixMo focuses on 2D imagery through separate tasks (PixMo-Cap for dense captioning and PixMo-Points for pointing), DenseAnnotate introduces a unified online annotation platform that enables the simultaneous collection of dense captions and pointing annotations within a single interface, and further extends dense captioning capabilities to complex 3D assets. By constructing our MLDC-3D dataset, we directly address the critical lack of scene-level high-quality data required for models dedicated to 3D understanding. Furthermore, DenseAnnotate places a specialized emphasis on capturing cultural nuances through our MLDC-MC dataset. This collection leverages native-language annotators to acquire detailed and culturally aligned descriptions, resulting in significantly longer captions, thus ensuring a depth of linguistic and cultural representation that complements existing open MLLMs efforts.</p>\n\n",

In the second stage, human annotators interact with the data through multiple operations&#8212;such as pointing and naming for 2D images, and zooming, panning, and freely rotating for 3D objects or scenes. In the latter case, annotators can also isolate and closely examine individual objects within the scene before producing their audio descriptions. To make the captions dense enough, we set the minimum recording times as follows: 60 seconds for images or 3D scenes, and 20 seconds for 3D objects. The recordings are transcribed into raw captions, and annotators can edit typos. We recruit multiple annotators to label each of the images or 3D assets. In the last stage, multiple raw captions are summarized using LLMs to produce high-quality, dense captions, thereby enhancing both the accuracy and richness of the annotations.</p>\n\n",

This approach not only enables annotators to become familiar with the objects in the scene first, but also increases the density of the overall description. Temporal constraints enforce minimum recording durations (20 seconds for individual objects, 60 seconds for scenes or images) with automatic 3-minute cutoffs to balance annotation depth and annotator fatigue. Also, we developed a dual-transcript preservation mechanism that stores both the automatically generated transcription from OpenAI&#8217;s Whisper API and the user-edited version, enabling us to detect excessive discrepancies between them and identify cases where annotators might have copied the VLMs&#8217; output instead of recording manually.

The COCO caption is very short and fails to capture the majority of the detail in the image, while the ShareGPT4V caption is more detailed but contains major inaccuracies. For instance, it refers to a woman with a green bag, but the woman in the background does not have a green bag. It also claims that the person in the foreground is carrying a briefcase, which is also untrue. Our human-annotated caption is able to capture a large amount of the detail in the picture while also not containing factual inaccuracies.</p>\n\n",

PointLLM is exclusively trained on 3D objects, can handle scene-level point clouds, but it exhibits only limited capability for captioning, let alone complex tasks.

Task creators can either adopt the system&#8217;s suggested questions or input their own guidance for annotators. In the second stage, human annotators interact with the data through multiple operations&#8212;such as pointing and naming for 2D images, and zooming, panning, and freely rotating for 3D objects or scenes. In the latter case, annotators can also isolate and closely examine individual objects within the scene before producing their audio descriptions. To make the captions dense enough, we set the minimum recording times as follows: 60 seconds for images or 3D scenes, and 20 seconds for 3D objects. The recordings are transcribed into raw captions, and annotators can edit typos. We recruit multiple annotators to label each of the images or 3D assets. In the last stage, multiple raw captions are summarized using LLMs to produce high-quality, dense captions, thereby enhancing both the accuracy and richness of the annotations.</p>\n\n",

For 3D scene tasks, the system implements a mandatory sequential workflow: individual object annotations (annotation step 1) must be completed first, then the system unlocks the scene-level recording interface (annotation step 2). This approach not only enables annotators to become familiar with the objects in the scene first, but also increases the density of the overall description. Temporal constraints enforce minimum recording durations (20 seconds for individual objects, 60 seconds for scenes or images) with automatic 3-minute cutoffs to balance annotation depth and annotator fatigue. Also, we developed a dual-transcript preservation mechanism that stores both the automatically generated transcription from OpenAI&#8217;s Whisper API and the user-edited version, enabling us to detect excessive discrepancies between them and identify cases where annotators might have copied the VLMs&#8217; output instead of recording manually.
