To address this limitation, we introduce <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">UltraVoice</span>, the first large-scale speech dialogue dataset engineered for multiple fine-grained speech style control. Encompassing over 830 hours of speech dialogues, UltraVoice provides instructions across six key speech stylistic dimensions: emotion, speed, volume, accent, language, and composite styles. Fine-tuning leading models such as SLAM-Omni and VocalNet on UltraVoice significantly enhances their fine-grained speech stylistic controllability without degrading core conversational abilities. Specifically, our fine-tuned models achieve improvements of 29.12-42.33% in Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and 14.61-40.09 percentage points in Instruction Following Rate (IFR) on multi-dimensional control tasks designed in the UltraVoice.\nMoreover, on the URO-Bench benchmark, our fine-tuned models demonstrate substantial gains in core understanding, reasoning, and conversational abilities, with average improvements of +10.84% on the Basic setting and +7.87% on the Pro setting. Furthermore, the dataset&#8217;s utility extends to training controllable Text-to-Speech (TTS) models, underscoring its high quality and broad applicability for expressive speech synthesis.

Models based on the LLaMA backbone (e.g., VocalNet-1B and 8B) exhibit a slight MOS decline and stagnant IFR, while Qwen-based models (e.g., SLAM-Omni-0.5B and VocalNet-7B) achieve clear gains. This discrepancy likely stems from differences in multilingual pretraining exposure. Language control requires full responses in a different language, introducing unique generalization challenges.

This improvement is particularly pronounced for smaller models with weaker baseline performance. For instance, the IFR of SLAM-Omni-0.5B surged from 28.30% to 68.39%, while VocalNet-1B&#8217;s score increased from 36.28% to 55.91%. These results demonstrate that even resource-constrained models can achieve substantial gains in responsiveness to control instructions through UltraVoice.

However, the Language control dimension presents a notable exception. Models based on the LLaMA backbone (e.g., VocalNet-1B and 8B) exhibit a slight MOS decline and stagnant IFR, while Qwen-based models (e.g., SLAM-Omni-0.5B and VocalNet-7B) achieve clear gains. This discrepancy likely stems from differences in multilingual pretraining exposure. Language control requires full responses in a different language, introducing unique generalization challenges. The current fine-tuning data lacks sufficient multilingual diversity and volume, limiting the models&#8217; ability to generalize. Future work should explore targeted augmentation of multilingual instruction data to address this limitation.</p>\n\n",

The dataset&#8217;s high quality and generalization were further validated through strong performance on the URO-Bench benchmark and in controllable TTS tasks, establishing a solid foundation for expressive spoken dialogue modeling. While this work represents a significant step forward, the full scope of human-like expressive speech presents formidable long-term challenges. The framework and data we provide can be extended to explore these frontiers, such as modeling the dynamic evolution of styles within multi-turn conversations or capturing the nuanced paralinguistic features in massively multilingual contexts. Addressing these complex scenarios, though beyond the scope of this paper, will be critical for developing the next generation of truly context-aware and intelligent speech interaction systems.</p>\n\n",

To address this limitation, we introduce <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">UltraVoice</span>, the first large-scale speech dialogue dataset engineered for multiple fine-grained speech style control. Encompassing over 830 hours of speech dialogues, UltraVoice provides instructions across six key speech stylistic dimensions: emotion, speed, volume, accent, language, and composite styles. Fine-tuning leading models such as SLAM-Omni and VocalNet on UltraVoice significantly enhances their fine-grained speech stylistic controllability without degrading core conversational abilities. Specifically, our fine-tuned models achieve improvements of 29.12-42.33% in Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and 14.61-40.09 percentage points in Instruction Following Rate (IFR) on multi-dimensional control tasks designed in the UltraVoice.\nMoreover, on the URO-Bench benchmark, our fine-tuned models demonstrate substantial gains in core understanding, reasoning, and conversational abilities, with average improvements of +10.84% on the Basic setting and +7.87% on the Pro setting. Furthermore, the dataset&#8217;s utility extends to training controllable Text-to-Speech (TTS) models, underscoring its high quality and broad applicability for expressive speech synthesis.

This discrepancy likely stems from differences in multilingual pretraining exposure. Language control requires full responses in a different language, introducing unique generalization challenges.

For instance, the overall MOS for VocalNet-7B increased from 2.73 to 3.59, while VocalNet-8B&#8217;s score rose from 2.85 to 3.68.

To address this limitation, we introduce <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">UltraVoice</span>, the first large-scale speech dialogue dataset engineered for multiple fine-grained speech style control. Encompassing over 830 hours of speech dialogues, UltraVoice provides instructions across six key speech stylistic dimensions: emotion, speed, volume, accent, language, and composite styles. Fine-tuning leading models such as SLAM-Omni and VocalNet on UltraVoice significantly enhances their fine-grained speech stylistic controllability without degrading core conversational abilities. Specifically, our fine-tuned models achieve improvements of 29.12-42.33% in Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and 14.61-40.09 percentage points in Instruction Following Rate (IFR) on multi-dimensional control tasks designed in the UltraVoice.\nMoreover, on the URO-Bench benchmark, our fine-tuned models demonstrate substantial gains in core understanding, reasoning, and conversational abilities, with average improvements of +10.84% on the Basic setting and +7.87% on the Pro setting. Furthermore, the dataset&#8217;s utility extends to training controllable Text-to-Speech (TTS) models, underscoring its high quality and broad applicability for expressive speech synthesis.

This improvement is particularly pronounced for smaller models with weaker baseline performance. For instance, the IFR of SLAM-Omni-0.5B surged from 28.30% to 68.39%, while VocalNet-1B&#8217;s score increased from 36.28% to 55.91%.

However, the Language control dimension presents a notable exception. Models based on the LLaMA backbone (e.g., VocalNet-1B and 8B) exhibit a slight MOS decline and stagnant IFR, while Qwen-based models (e.g., SLAM-Omni-0.5B and VocalNet-7B) achieve clear gains. This discrepancy likely stems from differences in multilingual pretraining exposure. Language control requires full responses in a different language, introducing unique generalization challenges. The current fine-tuning data lacks sufficient multilingual diversity and volume, limiting the models&#8217; ability to generalize. Future work should explore targeted augmentation of multilingual instruction data to address this limitation.</p>\n\n",

The only exception to this positive trend is a performance drop in Pro Reasoning (from 24.72 to 20.07) for the smallest model, SLAM-Omni-0.5B. We attribute this to the current dataset&#8217;s focus on single-turn interactions, which may not sufficiently support complex, multi-turn reasoning.

To address this limitation, we introduce <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">UltraVoice</span>, the first large-scale speech dialogue dataset engineered for multiple fine-grained speech style control. Encompassing over 830 hours of speech dialogues, UltraVoice provides instructions across six key speech stylistic dimensions: emotion, speed, volume, accent, language, and composite styles. Fine-tuning leading models such as SLAM-Omni and VocalNet on UltraVoice significantly enhances their fine-grained speech stylistic controllability without degrading core conversational abilities. Specifically, our fine-tuned models achieve improvements of 29.12-42.33% in Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and 14.61-40.09 percentage points in Instruction Following Rate (IFR) on multi-dimensional control tasks designed in the UltraVoice.\nMoreover, on the URO-Bench benchmark, our fine-tuned models demonstrate substantial gains in core understanding, reasoning, and conversational abilities, with average improvements of +10.84% on the Basic setting and +7.87% on the Pro setting. Furthermore, the dataset&#8217;s utility extends to training controllable Text-to-Speech (TTS) models, underscoring its high quality and broad applicability for expressive speech synthesis.

This discrepancy likely stems from differences in multilingual pretraining exposure. Language control requires full responses in a different language, introducing unique generalization challenges.

This necessitates a new approach beyond simple adaptation. <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">Second</span>, both collecting real data and repurposing existing resources present major obstacles.

Its success hinges not only on selecting a sufficiently expressive TTS model <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep\">(Du et al., <a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2510.22588v1#bib.bib9\" title=\"\">2024a</a>; <a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2510.22588v1#bib.bib10\" title=\"\">b</a>; Wang et al., <a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2510.22588v1#bib.bib26\" title=\"\">2025a</a>; Zhou et al., <a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2510.22588v1#bib.bib36\" title=\"\">2025</a>)</cite> to avoid monotonous outputs but, more critically, on a sophisticated generation strategy.

The dataset&#8217;s high quality and generalization were further validated through strong performance on the URO-Bench benchmark and in controllable TTS tasks, establishing a solid foundation for expressive spoken dialogue modeling. While this work represents a significant step forward, the full scope of human-like expressive speech presents formidable long-term challenges. The framework and data we provide can be extended to explore these frontiers, such as modeling the dynamic evolution of styles within multi-turn conversations or capturing the nuanced paralinguistic features in massively multilingual contexts.

To address this limitation, we introduce <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">UltraVoice</span>, the first large-scale speech dialogue dataset engineered for multiple fine-grained speech style control. Encompassing over 830 hours of speech dialogues, UltraVoice provides instructions across six key speech stylistic dimensions: emotion, speed, volume, accent, language, and composite styles. Fine-tuning leading models such as SLAM-Omni and VocalNet on UltraVoice significantly enhances their fine-grained speech stylistic controllability without degrading core conversational abilities. Specifically, our fine-tuned models achieve improvements of 29.12-42.33% in Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and 14.61-40.09 percentage points in Instruction Following Rate (IFR) on multi-dimensional control tasks designed in the UltraVoice.\nMoreover, on the URO-Bench benchmark, our fine-tuned models demonstrate substantial gains in core understanding, reasoning, and conversational abilities, with average improvements of +10.84% on the Basic setting and +7.87% on the Pro setting. Furthermore, the dataset&#8217;s utility extends to training controllable Text-to-Speech (TTS) models, underscoring its high quality and broad applicability for expressive speech synthesis.

Models based on the LLaMA backbone (e.g., VocalNet-1B and 8B) exhibit a slight MOS decline and stagnant IFR, while Qwen-based models (e.g., SLAM-Omni-0.5B and VocalNet-7B) achieve clear gains. This discrepancy likely stems from differences in multilingual pretraining exposure. Language control requires full responses in a different language, introducing unique generalization challenges. The current fine-tuning data lacks sufficient multilingual diversity and volume, limiting the models&#8217; ability to generalize. Future work should explore targeted augmentation of multilingual instruction data to address this limitation.</p>\n\n",

To address this limitation, we introduce <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">UltraVoice</span>, the first large-scale speech dialogue dataset engineered for multiple fine-grained speech style control. Encompassing over 830 hours of speech dialogues, UltraVoice provides instructions across six key speech stylistic dimensions: emotion, speed, volume, accent, language, and composite styles. Fine-tuning leading models such as SLAM-Omni and VocalNet on UltraVoice significantly enhances their fine-grained speech stylistic controllability without degrading core conversational abilities. Specifically, our fine-tuned models achieve improvements of 29.12-42.33% in Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and 14.61-40.09 percentage points in Instruction Following Rate (IFR) on multi-dimensional control tasks designed in the UltraVoice.\nMoreover, on the URO-Bench benchmark, our fine-tuned models demonstrate substantial gains in core understanding, reasoning, and conversational abilities, with average improvements of +10.84% on the Basic setting and +7.87% on the Pro setting. Furthermore, the dataset&#8217;s utility extends to training controllable Text-to-Speech (TTS) models, underscoring its high quality and broad applicability for expressive speech synthesis.

For each dimension, we used GPT-4o <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep\">(Hurst et al., <a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2510.22588v1#bib.bib19\" title=\"\">2024</a>)</cite> to generate diverse and natural style prompts (see <a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2510.22588v1#A5\" title=\"Appendix E Prompts &#8227; UltraVoice: Scaling Fine-GrainedStyle-Controlled Speech Conversationsfor Spoken Dialogue Models\"><span class=\"ltx_text ltx_ref_tag\">Appendix</span>&#160;<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_ref_tag\">E</span></a> for all prompt templates), leveraging semantically similar expressions (e.g., &#8220;respond in a joyful tone&#8221; vs. &#8220;reply with a cheerful voice&#8221;).

This discrepancy likely stems from differences in multilingual pretraining exposure. Language control requires full responses in a different language, introducing unique generalization challenges.

To address this limitation, we introduce <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">UltraVoice</span>, the first large-scale speech dialogue dataset engineered for multiple fine-grained speech style control. Encompassing over 830 hours of speech dialogues, UltraVoice provides instructions across six key speech stylistic dimensions: emotion, speed, volume, accent, language, and composite styles. Fine-tuning leading models such as SLAM-Omni and VocalNet on UltraVoice significantly enhances their fine-grained speech stylistic controllability without degrading core conversational abilities. Specifically, our fine-tuned models achieve improvements of 29.12-42.33% in Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and 14.61-40.09 percentage points in Instruction Following Rate (IFR) on multi-dimensional control tasks designed in the UltraVoice.\nMoreover, on the URO-Bench benchmark, our fine-tuned models demonstrate substantial gains in core understanding, reasoning, and conversational abilities, with average improvements of +10.84% on the Basic setting and +7.87% on the Pro setting. Furthermore, the dataset&#8217;s utility extends to training controllable Text-to-Speech (TTS) models, underscoring its high quality and broad applicability for expressive speech synthesis.

We have designed a bottom-up, fine-grained data generation pipeline that spans text preparation, style instruction injection, speech synthesis, and data filtering. This pipeline integrates everyday conversational texts with a wide range of speech style control types, ensuring high consistency and diversity in content, vocal style, and audio quality.

For each dimension, we used GPT-4o <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep\">(Hurst et al., <a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2510.22588v1#bib.bib19\" title=\"\">2024</a>)</cite> to generate diverse and natural style prompts (see <a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2510.22588v1#A5\" title=\"Appendix E Prompts &#8227; UltraVoice: Scaling Fine-GrainedStyle-Controlled Speech Conversationsfor Spoken Dialogue Models\"><span class=\"ltx_text ltx_ref_tag\">Appendix</span>&#160;<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_ref_tag\">E</span></a> for all prompt templates), leveraging semantically similar expressions (e.g., &#8220;respond in a joyful tone&#8221; vs. &#8220;reply with a cheerful voice&#8221;). Based on these prompts, GPT-4o was further invoked to generate stylized textual responses, ensuring alignment in semantics and tone. Additionally, we applied several practical adjustments to improve downstream TTS following <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet\">Fang et al. (<a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2510.22588v1#bib.bib12\" title=\"\">2024</a>)</cite>. For example, we expanded numbers into spoken forms (e.g., &#8220;123&#8221; &#8594; &#8220;one two three&#8221;) and rephrased code-related queries to encourage natural spoken language responses. These refinements ensured better speech synthesis fluency and user interaction quality.</p>\n\n",

However, the Language control dimension presents a notable exception. Models based on the LLaMA backbone (e.g., VocalNet-1B and 8B) exhibit a slight MOS decline and stagnant IFR, while Qwen-based models (e.g., SLAM-Omni-0.5B and VocalNet-7B) achieve clear gains. This discrepancy likely stems from differences in multilingual pretraining exposure. Language control requires full responses in a different language, introducing unique generalization challenges. The current fine-tuning data lacks sufficient multilingual diversity and volume, limiting the models&#8217; ability to generalize. Future work should explore targeted augmentation of multilingual instruction data to address this limitation.</p>\n\n",

While this work represents a significant step forward, the full scope of human-like expressive speech presents formidable long-term challenges. The framework and data we provide can be extended to explore these frontiers, such as modeling the dynamic evolution of styles within multi-turn conversations or capturing the nuanced paralinguistic features in massively multilingual contexts.

To address this limitation, we introduce <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">UltraVoice</span>, the first large-scale speech dialogue dataset engineered for multiple fine-grained speech style control. Encompassing over 830 hours of speech dialogues, UltraVoice provides instructions across six key speech stylistic dimensions: emotion, speed, volume, accent, language, and composite styles. Fine-tuning leading models such as SLAM-Omni and VocalNet on UltraVoice significantly enhances their fine-grained speech stylistic controllability without degrading core conversational abilities. Specifically, our fine-tuned models achieve improvements of 29.12-42.33% in Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and 14.61-40.09 percentage points in Instruction Following Rate (IFR) on multi-dimensional control tasks designed in the UltraVoice.\nMoreover, on the URO-Bench benchmark, our fine-tuned models demonstrate substantial gains in core understanding, reasoning, and conversational abilities, with average improvements of +10.84% on the Basic setting and +7.87% on the Pro setting. Furthermore, the dataset&#8217;s utility extends to training controllable Text-to-Speech (TTS) models, underscoring its high quality and broad applicability for expressive speech synthesis.

The common practice of simply applying Text-to-Speech (TTS) to text-based dialogue datasets fails to inject authentic paralinguistic information. This process results in speech that is linguistically correct but expressively impoverished, lacking the genuine variations in emotion, tone, and prosody that characterize human interaction. Consequently, models are trained on acoustically sterile data, learning what to say, but never learning how to say it with meaningful, human-like expression.</p>\n\n",

However, the Language control dimension presents a notable exception. Models based on the LLaMA backbone (e.g., VocalNet-1B and 8B) exhibit a slight MOS decline and stagnant IFR, while Qwen-based models (e.g., SLAM-Omni-0.5B and VocalNet-7B) achieve clear gains. This discrepancy likely stems from differences in multilingual pretraining exposure. Language control requires full responses in a different language, introducing unique generalization challenges. The current fine-tuning data lacks sufficient multilingual diversity and volume, limiting the models&#8217; ability to generalize. Future work should explore targeted augmentation of multilingual instruction data to address this limitation.</p>\n\n",

By fine-tuning mainstream spoken dialogue models on UltraVoice, we significantly enhanced their controllability over diverse fine-grained speech styles, while also improving their overall speech naturalness and general conversational competence. The dataset&#8217;s high quality and generalization were further validated through strong performance on the URO-Bench benchmark and in controllable TTS tasks, establishing a solid foundation for expressive spoken dialogue modeling. While this work represents a significant step forward, the full scope of human-like expressive speech presents formidable long-term challenges. The framework and data we provide can be extended to explore these frontiers, such as modeling the dynamic evolution of styles within multi-turn conversations or capturing the nuanced paralinguistic features in massively multilingual contexts. Addressing these complex scenarios, though beyond the scope of this paper, will be critical for developing the next generation of truly context-aware and intelligent speech interaction systems.</p>\n\n",

To address this limitation, we introduce <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">UltraVoice</span>, the first large-scale speech dialogue dataset engineered for multiple fine-grained speech style control. Encompassing over 830 hours of speech dialogues, UltraVoice provides instructions across six key speech stylistic dimensions: emotion, speed, volume, accent, language, and composite styles. Fine-tuning leading models such as SLAM-Omni and VocalNet on UltraVoice significantly enhances their fine-grained speech stylistic controllability without degrading core conversational abilities. Specifically, our fine-tuned models achieve improvements of 29.12-42.33% in Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and 14.61-40.09 percentage points in Instruction Following Rate (IFR) on multi-dimensional control tasks designed in the UltraVoice.\nMoreover, on the URO-Bench benchmark, our fine-tuned models demonstrate substantial gains in core understanding, reasoning, and conversational abilities, with average improvements of +10.84% on the Basic setting and +7.87% on the Pro setting. Furthermore, the dataset&#8217;s utility extends to training controllable Text-to-Speech (TTS) models, underscoring its high quality and broad applicability for expressive speech synthesis.

The speech it produces is functionally correct, but expressively sterile. This expressive gap stems from a fundamental flaw in existing training data. The common practice of simply applying Text-to-Speech (TTS) to text-based dialogue datasets fails to inject authentic paralinguistic information. This process results in speech that is linguistically correct but expressively impoverished, lacking the genuine variations in emotion, tone, and prosody that characterize human interaction. Consequently, models are trained on acoustically sterile data, learning what to say, but never learning how to say it with meaningful, human-like expression.</p>\n\n",

To address this limitation, we introduce <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">UltraVoice</span>, the first large-scale speech dialogue dataset engineered for multiple fine-grained speech style control. Encompassing over 830 hours of speech dialogues, UltraVoice provides instructions across six key speech stylistic dimensions: emotion, speed, volume, accent, language, and composite styles. Fine-tuning leading models such as SLAM-Omni and VocalNet on UltraVoice significantly enhances their fine-grained speech stylistic controllability without degrading core conversational abilities. Specifically, our fine-tuned models achieve improvements of 29.12-42.33% in Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and 14.61-40.09 percentage points in Instruction Following Rate (IFR) on multi-dimensional control tasks designed in the UltraVoice.\nMoreover, on the URO-Bench benchmark, our fine-tuned models demonstrate substantial gains in core understanding, reasoning, and conversational abilities, with average improvements of +10.84% on the Basic setting and +7.87% on the Pro setting. Furthermore, the dataset&#8217;s utility extends to training controllable Text-to-Speech (TTS) models, underscoring its high quality and broad applicability for expressive speech synthesis.

The common practice of simply applying Text-to-Speech (TTS) to text-based dialogue datasets fails to inject authentic paralinguistic information. This process results in speech that is linguistically correct but expressively impoverished, lacking the genuine variations in emotion, tone, and prosody that characterize human interaction.

To address this limitation, we introduce <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">UltraVoice</span>, the first large-scale speech dialogue dataset engineered for multiple fine-grained speech style control. Encompassing over 830 hours of speech dialogues, UltraVoice provides instructions across six key speech stylistic dimensions: emotion, speed, volume, accent, language, and composite styles. Fine-tuning leading models such as SLAM-Omni and VocalNet on UltraVoice significantly enhances their fine-grained speech stylistic controllability without degrading core conversational abilities. Specifically, our fine-tuned models achieve improvements of 29.12-42.33% in Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and 14.61-40.09 percentage points in Instruction Following Rate (IFR) on multi-dimensional control tasks designed in the UltraVoice.\nMoreover, on the URO-Bench benchmark, our fine-tuned models demonstrate substantial gains in core understanding, reasoning, and conversational abilities, with average improvements of +10.84% on the Basic setting and +7.87% on the Pro setting. Furthermore, the dataset&#8217;s utility extends to training controllable Text-to-Speech (TTS) models, underscoring its high quality and broad applicability for expressive speech synthesis.

This process results in speech that is linguistically correct but expressively impoverished, lacking the genuine variations in emotion, tone, and prosody that characterize human interaction.

To address this limitation, we introduce <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">UltraVoice</span>, the first large-scale speech dialogue dataset engineered for multiple fine-grained speech style control. Encompassing over 830 hours of speech dialogues, UltraVoice provides instructions across six key speech stylistic dimensions: emotion, speed, volume, accent, language, and composite styles. Fine-tuning leading models such as SLAM-Omni and VocalNet on UltraVoice significantly enhances their fine-grained speech stylistic controllability without degrading core conversational abilities. Specifically, our fine-tuned models achieve improvements of 29.12-42.33% in Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and 14.61-40.09 percentage points in Instruction Following Rate (IFR) on multi-dimensional control tasks designed in the UltraVoice.\nMoreover, on the URO-Bench benchmark, our fine-tuned models demonstrate substantial gains in core understanding, reasoning, and conversational abilities, with average improvements of +10.84% on the Basic setting and +7.87% on the Pro setting. Furthermore, the dataset&#8217;s utility extends to training controllable Text-to-Speech (TTS) models, underscoring its high quality and broad applicability for expressive speech synthesis.

Notably, the VocalNet-7B SFT model establishes a new state-of-the-art, outperforming strong baselines like Qwen2.5-Omni-7B <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep\">(Xu et al., <a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2510.22588v1#bib.bib32\" title=\"\">2025</a>)</cite> and GLM4-Voice-9B <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep\">(Zeng et al., <a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2510.22588v1#bib.bib35\" title=\"\">2024</a>)</cite>, highlighting practical value beyond style control. The only exception to this positive trend is a performance drop in Pro Reasoning (from 24.72 to 20.07) for the smallest model, SLAM-Omni-0.5B. We attribute this to the current dataset&#8217;s focus on single-turn interactions, which may not sufficiently support complex, multi-turn reasoning. Future work could address this by incorporating multi-turn dialogue examples during SFT.</p>\n\n",

By fine-tuning mainstream spoken dialogue models on UltraVoice, we significantly enhanced their controllability over diverse fine-grained speech styles, while also improving their overall speech naturalness and general conversational competence. The dataset&#8217;s high quality and generalization were further validated through strong performance on the URO-Bench benchmark and in controllable TTS tasks, establishing a solid foundation for expressive spoken dialogue modeling. While this work represents a significant step forward, the full scope of human-like expressive speech presents formidable long-term challenges. The framework and data we provide can be extended to explore these frontiers, such as modeling the dynamic evolution of styles within multi-turn conversations or capturing the nuanced paralinguistic features in massively multilingual contexts. Addressing these complex scenarios, though beyond the scope of this paper, will be critical for developing the next generation of truly context-aware and intelligent speech interaction systems.</p>\n\n",
