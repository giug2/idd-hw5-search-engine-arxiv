The challenge of data heterogeneity arises because the training data for LongCat-Flash-Omni includes speech, vision, and text, which show significant and dynamic differences in token distribution (Figure&#160;<a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2511.00279v1#S5.F7\" title=\"Figure 7 &#8227; 5.1 Multimodal Decoupling Framework &#8227; 5 Training Infrastructures &#8227; LongCat-Flash-Omni Technical Report\"><span class=\"ltx_text ltx_ref_tag\">7</span></a>).\nModel heterogeneity is evident in the substantially different computational workloads across the three core components of LongCat-Flash-Omni: the vision encoder, the audio encoder, and the LLM decoder (Table&#160;<a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2511.00279v1#S5.F7\" title=\"Figure 7 &#8227; 5.1 Multimodal Decoupling Framework &#8227; 5 Training Infrastructures &#8227; LongCat-Flash-Omni Technical Report\"><span class=\"ltx_text ltx_ref_tag\">7</span></a>).\nTo address the aforementioned challenges, there are two primary optimization approaches.

Specifically, in terms of real-timeness, our model tends to be overly sensitive to user pauses, often initiating responses prematurely and interrupting users mid-conversation. Regarding human-likeness, it occasionally exhibits pronunciation errors, stuttering, and robotic or electronic audio artifacts.

To develop this capability, we curate an in-house time-synchronized audio-visual dataset by prompting a strong multimodal language model to generate high-quality text QA pairs that are involved with both audio and visual content in the video.\nSpecifically, the videos are sourced from multiple domains, including multimodal data containing rich music and audio event contents.\nAll samples are organized in an interleaved chunk format, which enables the model to better perceive and reason over temporally aligned audio-visual content, thereby strengthening its capacity for multimodal understanding.\n</p>\n\n",

Guided by this taxonomy, we collect a mixture of public and in-house videos as the source data to ensure balanced coverage across abilities. For each video, we first perform scene segmentation using PySceneDetect <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep\">(Breakthrough, <a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2511.00279v1#bib.bib35\" title=\"\">2025</a>)</cite> to obtain a sequence of clips. For every clip, a powerful multimodal language model generates multiple rounds of progressively deep and context-aware QA pairs. In each round, subsequent queries build upon preceding conversations with logical progression, referential dependency, or anaphoric linkage to earlier turns. Such conversations encourage the model to reason over extended dialogue contexts, maintain entity and reference consistency in a natural, human-like audio-visual interaction setting. We then apply an automatic verification pipeline, employing an LLM-as-a-judge framework to evaluate and discard low-quality or inconsistent QA pairs. The remaining qualified samples are then composed into multi-turn dialogue, enabling the model to learn both intra-scene conversational continuity and inter-scene contextual transitions, thereby better reflecting real-world audio-visual interactions.</p>\n\n",

Speech, on the other hand, is the acoustic manifestation of human thoughts and concepts, a sequential signal like text, but enriched with paralinguistic information such as speaker timbre, emotion, prosody, and accent. However, its semantic density is much lower than that of text: while a typical speech tokenizer operating at 12.5 Hz must generate roughly 12.5 tokens per second, humans only speak about 3-4 text tokens per second.

Specifically, in terms of real-timeness, our model tends to be overly sensitive to user pauses, often initiating responses prematurely and interrupting users mid-conversation. Regarding human-likeness, it occasionally exhibits pronunciation errors, stuttering, and robotic or electronic audio artifacts. In terms of accuracy, while our model shows strong capability in recognizing dynamic objects, its recognition performance declines when processing text and numerical information.

However, collecting large-scale real-world audio-visual interaction data is resource-intensive and impractical, and synthesizing complex and reasonable interaction data is difficult for existing models that tend to generate hallucination.

Each modality exhibits distinct structural properties and representational characteristics.\nText, for instance, is a highly compressed and abstract symbolic representation of human knowledge, and LLMs have demonstrated remarkable success in modeling large-scale text sequences. Speech, on the other hand, is the acoustic manifestation of human thoughts and concepts, a sequential signal like text, but enriched with paralinguistic information such as speaker timbre, emotion, prosody, and accent. However, its semantic density is much lower than that of text: while a typical speech tokenizer operating at 12.5 Hz must generate roughly 12.5 tokens per second, humans only speak about 3-4 text tokens per second. This mismatch makes sequence modeling for speech inherently more challenging than for text.</p>\n\n",

It can receive various modalities as input, including text, audio, image, video, and their any arbitrary combination, and is able to directly generates speech tokens from the LLM backbone.\nLongCat-Flash-Omni employs a vision encoder and an audio encoder as multimodal perceivers. An LLM processes the multimodal inputs and generates text and audio tokens. An audio decoder reconstructs the waveform from the speech tokens generated by the LLM, enabling natural speech interaction.\nAll modules are carefully designed to support efficient streaming inference. The audio encoder, vision encoder, and audio decoder are lightweight components, each with approximately 600M parameters.

We then improve the dataset through re-captioning to generate dense, fine-grained captions with multiple open-source vision-language models while incorporating world knowledge from original annotations.

Each modality exhibits distinct structural properties and representational characteristics.\nText, for instance, is a highly compressed and abstract symbolic representation of human knowledge, and LLMs have demonstrated remarkable success in modeling large-scale text sequences. Speech, on the other hand, is the acoustic manifestation of human thoughts and concepts, a sequential signal like text, but enriched with paralinguistic information such as speaker timbre, emotion, prosody, and accent. However, its semantic density is much lower than that of text: while a typical speech tokenizer operating at 12.5 Hz must generate roughly 12.5 tokens per second, humans only speak about 3-4 text tokens per second. This mismatch makes sequence modeling for speech inherently more challenging than for text.</p>\n\n",

Specifically, in terms of real-timeness, our model tends to be overly sensitive to user pauses, often initiating responses prematurely and interrupting users mid-conversation. Regarding human-likeness, it occasionally exhibits pronunciation errors, stuttering, and robotic or electronic audio artifacts. In terms of accuracy, while our model shows strong capability in recognizing dynamic objects, its recognition performance declines when processing text and numerical information. Additionally, we observe a tendency for our model to over-agree with users&#8217; statements while overlooking relevant visual content.\nThese aspects will be further optimized in the future work.\n</p>\n\n",

Specifically, in terms of real-timeness, our model tends to be overly sensitive to user pauses, often initiating responses prematurely and interrupting users mid-conversation. Regarding human-likeness, it occasionally exhibits pronunciation errors, stuttering, and robotic or electronic audio artifacts. In terms of accuracy, while our model shows strong capability in recognizing dynamic objects, its recognition performance declines when processing text and numerical information.

The seamless combination and transmission of multiple modalities significantly enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of human communication and interaction. In pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), the field of large language models (LLMs) is now rapidly evolving toward the integration of richer multimodal capabilities and more efficient human-AI interaction.\nRecent pioneers such as Gemini-2.5 <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep\">(Comanici et&#160;al., <a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2511.00279v1#bib.bib1\" title=\"\">2025</a>)</cite> and GPT-4o <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep\">(OpenAI, <a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2511.00279v1#bib.bib2\" title=\"\">2024</a>)</cite> have integrated text, audio, image, and video processing within a single model, enabling efficient audio-visual interaction.
