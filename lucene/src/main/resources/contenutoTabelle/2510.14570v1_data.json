Zero-shot models (CLAP, AES) perform poorly on TTA quality evaluation, as they can only provide coarse judgments and fail to capture quality differences. Traditional supervised fine-tuning methods (e.g., MusicEval-baseline, Clap-SFT) achieve moderate improvements over zero-shot baselines, but their performance remains limited and inconsistent across different dimensions and annotator groups. In contrast, large-model-based fine-tuning approaches show clear advantages.
