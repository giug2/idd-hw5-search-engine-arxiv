This work presents OLaPh (Optimal Language Phonemizer), a framework that combines large lexica, multiple NLP techniques, and compound resolution with a probabilistic scoring function. Evaluations in German and English show improved accuracy over previous approaches, including on a challenging dataset. To further address unresolved cases, we train a large language model on OLaPh-generated data, which achieves even stronger generalization and performance.

However, OLaPh outperformed the others in several cases on the German test data. In nearly all of these instances, OLaPh excelled with foreign words, primarily English, which were correctly identified by the language detection module and phonemized accordingly. Some sentences also included English clauses that were flawlessly detected. Additionally, a few German words were correctly phonemized only by OLaPh. For example, Kriegsspiel (&#8220;war game&#8221;) was phonemized as <span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\tipaencoding</span>/k<span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textinvscr</span>iks<span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textesh</span>pil/, while the other frameworks produced <span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\tipaencoding</span>/k<span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textinvscr</span>ikzspil/ and <span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\tipaencoding</span>/k<span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textfishhookr</span>ikspil/, omitting the meaningful phone [<span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\tipaencoding</span><span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textesh</span>]. In statistically ambiguous cases, the built-in language detection occasionally misidentified the origin language, leading to errors. For example, the German word <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">Stapler</span> (forklift) was incorrectly recognized as the English <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">stapler</span> and consequently misphonemized. In a few cases, all phonemization outputs were incorrect, or the pronunciation was inherently ambiguous or depends on user preference. This includes words like Montr&#233;al, where pronunciation depends on the language context, such as choosing between the French /<span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\tipaencoding</span>m\\&#771;textopeno.<span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textinvscr</span>eal / and the English /<span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\tipaencoding</span><span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textsecstress</span>m<span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textturnv</span>nt<span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textturnr</span>i<span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textlengthmark</span><span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textprimstress</span><span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textturnscripta</span>l/.\nTo better assess edge cases, a small test dataset was created with challenging phonemization examples.

However, OLaPh outperformed the others in several cases on the German test data. In nearly all of these instances, OLaPh excelled with foreign words, primarily English, which were correctly identified by the language detection module and phonemized accordingly. Some sentences also included English clauses that were flawlessly detected. Additionally, a few German words were correctly phonemized only by OLaPh. For example, Kriegsspiel (&#8220;war game&#8221;) was phonemized as <span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\tipaencoding</span>/k<span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textinvscr</span>iks<span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textesh</span>pil/, while the other frameworks produced <span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\tipaencoding</span>/k<span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textinvscr</span>ikzspil/ and <span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\tipaencoding</span>/k<span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textfishhookr</span>ikspil/, omitting the meaningful phone [<span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\tipaencoding</span><span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textesh</span>]. In statistically ambiguous cases, the built-in language detection occasionally misidentified the origin language, leading to errors. For example, the German word <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">Stapler</span> (forklift) was incorrectly recognized as the English <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">stapler</span> and consequently misphonemized. In a few cases, all phonemization outputs were incorrect, or the pronunciation was inherently ambiguous or depends on user preference. This includes words like Montr&#233;al, where pronunciation depends on the language context, such as choosing between the French /<span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\tipaencoding</span>m\\&#771;textopeno.<span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textinvscr</span>eal / and the English /<span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\tipaencoding</span><span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textsecstress</span>m<span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textturnv</span>nt<span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textturnr</span>i<span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textlengthmark</span><span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textprimstress</span><span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textturnscripta</span>l/.\nTo better assess edge cases, a small test dataset was created with challenging phonemization examples.

Traditional approaches use rule-based transformations and lexicon lookups, while more advanced methods apply preprocessing techniques or neural networks for improved accuracy on out-of-domain vocabulary. However, all systems struggle with names, loanwords, abbreviations, and homographs. This work presents OLaPh (Optimal Language Phonemizer), a framework that combines large lexica, multiple NLP techniques, and compound resolution with a probabilistic scoring function. Evaluations in German and English show improved accuracy over previous approaches, including on a challenging dataset. To further address unresolved cases, we train a large language model on OLaPh-generated data, which achieves even stronger generalization and performance. Together, the framework and LLM improve phonemization consistency and provide a freely available resource for future research.</p>\n\n",

However, OLaPh outperformed the others in several cases on the German test data. In nearly all of these instances, OLaPh excelled with foreign words, primarily English, which were correctly identified by the language detection module and phonemized accordingly. Some sentences also included English clauses that were flawlessly detected. Additionally, a few German words were correctly phonemized only by OLaPh. For example, Kriegsspiel (&#8220;war game&#8221;) was phonemized as <span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\tipaencoding</span>/k<span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textinvscr</span>iks<span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textesh</span>pil/, while the other frameworks produced <span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\tipaencoding</span>/k<span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textinvscr</span>ikzspil/ and <span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\tipaencoding</span>/k<span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textfishhookr</span>ikspil/, omitting the meaningful phone [<span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\tipaencoding</span><span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textesh</span>]. In statistically ambiguous cases, the built-in language detection occasionally misidentified the origin language, leading to errors. For example, the German word <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">Stapler</span> (forklift) was incorrectly recognized as the English <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">stapler</span> and consequently misphonemized. In a few cases, all phonemization outputs were incorrect, or the pronunciation was inherently ambiguous or depends on user preference. This includes words like Montr&#233;al, where pronunciation depends on the language context, such as choosing between the French /<span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\tipaencoding</span>m\\&#771;textopeno.<span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textinvscr</span>eal / and the English /<span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\tipaencoding</span><span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textsecstress</span>m<span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textturnv</span>nt<span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textturnr</span>i<span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textlengthmark</span><span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textprimstress</span><span class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined\">\\textturnscripta</span>l/.\nTo better assess edge cases, a small test dataset was created with challenging phonemization examples.
