In this work, we reveal through systematic experimentation that although LSLMs lose some text input performance after speech-text alignment training, the performance gap between speech and text inputs is more pronounced, which we refer to as the <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">modality gap</span>.\nTo understand this gap, we analyze both coarse- and fine-grained text and speech representations.\nAt the coarse-grained level, representations of speech and text in deeper layers are found to be increasingly aligned in direction (cosine similarity), while concurrently diverging in magnitude (Euclidean distance). We further find that representation similarity is strongly correlated with the modality gap.\nAt the fine-grained level, a spontaneous token-level alignment pattern between text and speech representations is observed.\nBased on this, we introduce the Alignment Path Score to quantify token-level alignment quality, which exhibits stronger correlation with the modality gap.\nBuilding on these insights, we design targeted interventions on critical tokens through angle projection and length normalization. These strategies demonstrate the potential to improve correctness for speech inputs. Our study provides the first systematic empirical analysis of the modality gap and alignment mechanisms in LSLMs, offering both theoretical and methodological guidance for future optimization.</p>\n\n",

To uncover the mechanisms behind this gap, we analyze speech-text alignment at both sequence and token levels.\nSequence-level analysis tracks representation similarity across layers and training, establishing its linear relationship with the modality gap.\nAt the token level, we reveal word-frame alignment structures and propose the Alignment Path Score, which shows a stronger correlation with the proposed modality gap. Targeted intervention experiments further demonstrate that improving token-level alignment can enhance speech inference accuracy.\nThis study deepens understanding of how large language models process and comprehend spoken language.</p>\n\n",

In this work, we reveal through systematic experimentation that although LSLMs lose some text input performance after speech-text alignment training, the performance gap between speech and text inputs is more pronounced, which we refer to as the <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">modality gap</span>.\nTo understand this gap, we analyze both coarse- and fine-grained text and speech representations.\nAt the coarse-grained level, representations of speech and text in deeper layers are found to be increasingly aligned in direction (cosine similarity), while concurrently diverging in magnitude (Euclidean distance). We further find that representation similarity is strongly correlated with the modality gap.\nAt the fine-grained level, a spontaneous token-level alignment pattern between text and speech representations is observed.\nBased on this, we introduce the Alignment Path Score to quantify token-level alignment quality, which exhibits stronger correlation with the modality gap.\nBuilding on these insights, we design targeted interventions on critical tokens through angle projection and length normalization. These strategies demonstrate the potential to improve correctness for speech inputs. Our study provides the first systematic empirical analysis of the modality gap and alignment mechanisms in LSLMs, offering both theoretical and methodological guidance for future optimization.</p>\n\n",

This decline can be attributed to two factors: (1) fine-tuning&#8211;induced erosion of reasoning and generation capabilities, with an average drop of 8.79%; and (2) suboptimal speech&#8211;text alignment, with an average drop of 16.46%. Given the variety of model sizes and tuning methods evaluated, this trend appears general. This phenomenon indicates that the observed performance degradation stems primarily from the speech&#8211;text modality gap, and that bridging this gap is crucial to enhance LSLM speech processing.\nIndeed, this modality gap is not unique to our setup, as we observe a similar trend across diverse public LSLMs in Appendix&#160;<a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2510.12116v1#A2.SS1\" title=\"B.1 Modality Gap Across Diverse Paradigms &#8227; Appendix B Validation on External LSLM &#8227; Understanding the Modality Gap: An Empirical Study on the Speech-Text Alignment Mechanism of Large Speech Language Models\"><span class=\"ltx_text ltx_ref_tag\">B.1</span></a>.</p>\n\n",

In this work, we reveal through systematic experimentation that although LSLMs lose some text input performance after speech-text alignment training, the performance gap between speech and text inputs is more pronounced, which we refer to as the <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">modality gap</span>.\nTo understand this gap, we analyze both coarse- and fine-grained text and speech representations.\nAt the coarse-grained level, representations of speech and text in deeper layers are found to be increasingly aligned in direction (cosine similarity), while concurrently diverging in magnitude (Euclidean distance). We further find that representation similarity is strongly correlated with the modality gap.\nAt the fine-grained level, a spontaneous token-level alignment pattern between text and speech representations is observed.\nBased on this, we introduce the Alignment Path Score to quantify token-level alignment quality, which exhibits stronger correlation with the modality gap.\nBuilding on these insights, we design targeted interventions on critical tokens through angle projection and length normalization. These strategies demonstrate the potential to improve correctness for speech inputs. Our study provides the first systematic empirical analysis of the modality gap and alignment mechanisms in LSLMs, offering both theoretical and methodological guidance for future optimization.</p>\n\n",

In this work, we reveal through systematic experimentation that although LSLMs lose some text input performance after speech-text alignment training, the performance gap between speech and text inputs is more pronounced, which we refer to as the <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">modality gap</span>.\nTo understand this gap, we analyze both coarse- and fine-grained text and speech representations.\nAt the coarse-grained level, representations of speech and text in deeper layers are found to be increasingly aligned in direction (cosine similarity), while concurrently diverging in magnitude (Euclidean distance). We further find that representation similarity is strongly correlated with the modality gap.\nAt the fine-grained level, a spontaneous token-level alignment pattern between text and speech representations is observed.\nBased on this, we introduce the Alignment Path Score to quantify token-level alignment quality, which exhibits stronger correlation with the modality gap.\nBuilding on these insights, we design targeted interventions on critical tokens through angle projection and length normalization. These strategies demonstrate the potential to improve correctness for speech inputs. Our study provides the first systematic empirical analysis of the modality gap and alignment mechanisms in LSLMs, offering both theoretical and methodological guidance for future optimization.</p>\n\n",

This decline can be attributed to two factors: (1) fine-tuning&#8211;induced erosion of reasoning and generation capabilities, with an average drop of 8.79%; and (2) suboptimal speech&#8211;text alignment, with an average drop of 16.46%. Given the variety of model sizes and tuning methods evaluated, this trend appears general. This phenomenon indicates that the observed performance degradation stems primarily from the speech&#8211;text modality gap, and that bridging this gap is crucial to enhance LSLM speech processing.\nIndeed, this modality gap is not unique to our setup, as we observe a similar trend across diverse public LSLMs in Appendix&#160;<a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2510.12116v1#A2.SS1\" title=\"B.1 Modality Gap Across Diverse Paradigms &#8227; Appendix B Validation on External LSLM &#8227; Understanding the Modality Gap: An Empirical Study on the Speech-Text Alignment Mechanism of Large Speech Language Models\"><span class=\"ltx_text ltx_ref_tag\">B.1</span></a>.</p>\n\n",

In this work, we reveal through systematic experimentation that although LSLMs lose some text input performance after speech-text alignment training, the performance gap between speech and text inputs is more pronounced, which we refer to as the <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">modality gap</span>.\nTo understand this gap, we analyze both coarse- and fine-grained text and speech representations.\nAt the coarse-grained level, representations of speech and text in deeper layers are found to be increasingly aligned in direction (cosine similarity), while concurrently diverging in magnitude (Euclidean distance). We further find that representation similarity is strongly correlated with the modality gap.\nAt the fine-grained level, a spontaneous token-level alignment pattern between text and speech representations is observed.\nBased on this, we introduce the Alignment Path Score to quantify token-level alignment quality, which exhibits stronger correlation with the modality gap.\nBuilding on these insights, we design targeted interventions on critical tokens through angle projection and length normalization. These strategies demonstrate the potential to improve correctness for speech inputs. Our study provides the first systematic empirical analysis of the modality gap and alignment mechanisms in LSLMs, offering both theoretical and methodological guidance for future optimization.</p>\n\n",

We further find that representation similarity is strongly correlated with the modality gap.\nAt the fine-grained level, a spontaneous token-level alignment pattern between text and speech representations is observed.\nBased on this, we introduce the Alignment Path Score to quantify token-level alignment quality, which exhibits stronger correlation with the modality gap.\nBuilding on these insights, we design targeted interventions on critical tokens through angle projection and length normalization. These strategies demonstrate the potential to improve correctness for speech inputs. Our study provides the first systematic empirical analysis of the modality gap and alignment mechanisms in LSLMs, offering both theoretical and methodological guidance for future optimization.</p>\n\n",

(2) The monotonicity measured via cosine similarity remains consistently higher than that based on Euclidean distance, indicating that cosine similarity may be more effective in capturing ordered relationships in high-dimensional spaces. (3) Token-level alignment path consistency also demonstrates a general upward trend during training, implying that the alignment paths derived from the two similarity measures become increasingly similar. These observations are consistent across different model scales and training strategies, underscoring the robustness and effectiveness of the learned alignment mechanism.</p>\n\n",
