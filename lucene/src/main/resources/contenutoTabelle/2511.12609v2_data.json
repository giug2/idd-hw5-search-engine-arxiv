Key strengths include video understanding (+7% avg. of 8), omnimodallity understanding (+7% avg. of 4), and audiovisual reasoning (+4%).

For textual inputs, these components share the same position IDs, rendering Omni-Modality 3D RoPE functionally equivalent to the standard 1D-RoPE. For audio inputs, we align the temporal position IDs with absolute time. Specifically, we define 20 tokens as the minimum temporal unit, which corresponds to a duration of 3 seconds. Instead of adopting the original single-step increment of position IDs, we replace it with the variation rate of absolute time. For image inputs, the temporal IDs of visual tokens remain fixed, while the height and width IDs are assigned according to the spatial locations of tokens within the original image. Unlike M-RoPE, the height and width dimensions are traversed in a patch-wise manner, such that all tokens within a single vision patch are enumerated before proceeding to the next patch.

Subsequently, the model generates commands that specify the voice timbre for audio synthesis: fixed timbres include those of Brain, Jenny, and Xiaoxiao, while supported languages cover Chinese and English.

This is followed by the text content that the model needs to transcribe into speech, which is terminated with the special token &lt;speech end&gt;.

The results reveal that initial layers exhibit nearly identical routing across tasks, indicating common set of experts for low-level feature extraction. In deeper layers, routing patterns diverge, reflecting task-specific specialization, while the probability of selecting the null expert (Expert 5) decreases sharply, suggesting that computation is increasingly concentrated in semantically critical stages. The activation profiles align with the intended expert roles: Expert 1 dominates vision-centric tasks (Image, Video and omnimodal Understanding), Experts 2 and 3 are prominent in audio-related tasks (Audio and omnimodal Understanding), and Expert 4 consistently contributes across tasks as a general-purpose semantic expert. Notably, understanding tasks show dynamic, layer-dependent routing, implying adaptive allocation of computational resources from concrete to abstract representations. In contrast, generation tasks exhibit stable, uniform routing across layers, consistent with a homogeneous refinement process. These observations confirm that our MoE design effectively promotes functional specialization and learns efficient, task-dependent computation pathways.</p>\n\n",

We find that while a compact 20 tokens per second suffices for audio representation, generation requires 40 tokens per second to capture fine-grained acoustic details. Furthermore, smaller (0.5B) autoregressive models struggle with style conversion, a limitation we address by adopting a MoE architecture. For these models, training on token embeddings from a pre-trained base model proves more effective for capturing vocal style than end-to-end training. Together, these approaches form an effective framework for building efficient and expressive neural spoken systems. Building on these insights, our future work will follow Uni-MoE-Audio, using a single tokenizer for both understanding and generation tasks. This foundation will enable cross-modal training with text and video, facilitating context-aware and voice-preserved applications. Concurrently, we will optimize our MoE architecture with conditional routing for more efficient and controllable multi-speaker synthesis.</p>\n\n",

To enhance the model&#8217;s comprehension of multimodal data (Sec. <a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2511.12609v2#S2.SS3\" title=\"2.3 Main Architecture &#8227; 2 Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni &#8227; Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni: Scaling Language-Centric Omnimodal Large Model with Advanced MoE, Training and Data\"><span class=\"ltx_text ltx_ref_tag\">2.3</span></a>), we introduce Omni-Modality 3D RoPE, a mechanism that temporally aligns inputs from speech, text, video, and images. Within the MoE layer, we employ diverse experts to enable seamless switching between specialized modules. This is stabilized by null experts to realize a token skipping layer, modal-specific routed experts that ensure balanced training, and enhanced by small-size shared experts (only 1/8 of routed experts) that facilitate cross-modal knowledge transfer. For generation tasks (Sec. <a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2511.12609v2#S2.SS4\" title=\"2.4 Uni-Generation &#8227; 2 Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni &#8227; Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni: Scaling Language-Centric Omnimodal Large Model with Advanced MoE, Training and Data\"><span class=\"ltx_text ltx_ref_tag\">2.4</span></a>), the model utilizes dedicated control tokens. Audio Generation tokens govern language and role attributes, which are leveraged by context-aware MoE-TTS modules. Similarly, Image Generation tokens, composed of task and content instructions, bridge the foundation model to a task-aware diffusion transformer, enabling end-to-end image generation and editing.</p>\n\n",

For textual inputs, these components share the same position IDs, rendering Omni-Modality 3D RoPE functionally equivalent to the standard 1D-RoPE. For audio inputs, we align the temporal position IDs with absolute time. Specifically, we define 20 tokens as the minimum temporal unit, which corresponds to a duration of 3 seconds. Instead of adopting the original single-step increment of position IDs, we replace it with the variation rate of absolute time. For image inputs, the temporal IDs of visual tokens remain fixed, while the height and width IDs are assigned according to the spatial locations of tokens within the original image. Unlike M-RoPE, the height and width dimensions are traversed in a patch-wise manner, such that all tokens within a single vision patch are enumerated before proceeding to the next patch.

The cold-start phase aims to stimulate the model&#8217;s foundational reasoning capabilities across multimodal inputs&#8212;including text, images, and video&#8212;while online reinforcement learning enhances the model&#8217;s autonomous exploration and further refines its reasoning under sparse reward signals. However, during training, we observed limited improvement in the accuracy reward, particularly when processing full-modality data. To address this, we introduced a DPO stage to specifically strengthen the model&#8217;s reasoning ability. In this stage, we reuse rollout samples from the online RL phase under an &#8220;LLM as a Judge&#8221; mechanism, selecting those with a logical reasoning process and accurate outcomes as positive examples. Additionally, for samples that yielded zero accuracy during online training, we leverage closed-source commercial models (Gemini-2.5-Flash) as a teacher to generate high-quality reasoning demonstrations, thereby improving the student model, Uni-MoE 2.0. The GSPO-DPO pipeline supports iterative refinement for progressively stronger reasoning performance.

In deeper layers, routing patterns diverge, reflecting task-specific specialization, while the probability of selecting the null expert (Expert 5) decreases sharply, suggesting that computation is increasingly concentrated in semantically critical stages. The activation profiles align with the intended expert roles: Expert 1 dominates vision-centric tasks (Image, Video and omnimodal Understanding), Experts 2 and 3 are prominent in audio-related tasks (Audio and omnimodal Understanding), and Expert 4 consistently contributes across tasks as a general-purpose semantic expert. Notably, understanding tasks show dynamic, layer-dependent routing, implying adaptive allocation of computational resources from concrete to abstract representations. In contrast, generation tasks exhibit stable, uniform routing across layers, consistent with a homogeneous refinement process. These observations confirm that our MoE design effectively promotes functional specialization and learns efficient, task-dependent computation pathways.</p>\n\n",

A key trend in these middle layers is the steady increase in activation of the null expert (Expert 5), meaning the model learns to skip tokens that no longer need processing at intermediate stages.

We find that while a compact 20 tokens per second suffices for audio representation, generation requires 40 tokens per second to capture fine-grained acoustic details. Furthermore, smaller (0.5B) autoregressive models struggle with style conversion, a limitation we address by adopting a MoE architecture. For these models, training on token embeddings from a pre-trained base model proves more effective for capturing vocal style than end-to-end training. Together, these approaches form an effective framework for building efficient and expressive neural spoken systems. Building on these insights, our future work will follow Uni-MoE-Audio, using a single tokenizer for both understanding and generation tasks. This foundation will enable cross-modal training with text and video, facilitating context-aware and voice-preserved applications.

As a fully open-source omnimodal large model (OLM), it substantially advances Lychee&#8217;s Uni-MoE series in language-centric multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generating. Based on the dense LLM, we build <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni</span> from scratch through three core contributions: dynamic-capacity Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design, a progressive training strategy enhanced with an iterative reinforcement strategy, and a carefully curated multimodal data matching technique. It is capable of omnimodal understanding, as well as generating images, text, and speech.\n<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">Architecturally</span>, our new MoE framework balances computational efficiency and capability for 10 cross-modal inputs using shared, routed, and null experts, while our Omni-Modality 3D RoPE ensures spatio-temporal cross-modality alignment in the self-attention layer.\n<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">For training</span>, following cross-modal pretraining, we use a progressive supervised fine-tuning strategy that activates modality-specific experts and is enhanced by balanced data composition and an iterative GSPO-DPO method to stabilise RL training and improve reasoning.\n<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">Data-wise</span>, the base model, trained on approximately 75B tokens of open-source multimodal data, is equipped with special speech and image generation tokens, allowing it to learn these generative tasks by conditioning its outputs on linguistic cues.\nExtensive evaluation across 85 benchmarks demonstrates that our model achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance against leading OLMs, surpassing Qwen2.5-Omni (trained with 1.2T tokens) on over 50 of 76 benchmarks. Key strengths include video understanding (+7% avg. of 8), omnimodallity understanding (+7% avg. of 4), and audiovisual reasoning (+4%). It also advances long-form speech processing (WER reduced by up to 4.2%) and leads in low-level image processing and controllable generation across 5 metrics.</p>\n\n",

Similar to M-RoPE, we decompose the original rotary embedding into three components corresponding to the temporal, height, and width dimensions. For textual inputs, these components share the same position IDs, rendering Omni-Modality 3D RoPE functionally equivalent to the standard 1D-RoPE. For audio inputs, we align the temporal position IDs with absolute time. Specifically, we define 20 tokens as the minimum temporal unit, which corresponds to a duration of 3 seconds. Instead of adopting the original single-step increment of position IDs, we replace it with the variation rate of absolute time. For image inputs, the temporal IDs of visual tokens remain fixed, while the height and width IDs are assigned according to the spatial locations of tokens within the original image. Unlike M-RoPE, the height and width dimensions are traversed in a patch-wise manner, such that all tokens within a single vision patch are enumerated before proceeding to the next patch. For video inputs, the temporal IDs of each frame are incremented according to <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline\">absolute time</span>, while the height and width components follow the same ID assignment pattern as images.</p>\n\n",

Second, this model is transformed into a MoE architecture by replicating its FFN layers to create four experts, which are then fine-tuned on a diverse, multi-style, and multi-speaker dataset.

The cold-start phase aims to stimulate the model&#8217;s foundational reasoning capabilities across multimodal inputs&#8212;including text, images, and video&#8212;while online reinforcement learning enhances the model&#8217;s autonomous exploration and further refines its reasoning under sparse reward signals. However, during training, we observed limited improvement in the accuracy reward, particularly when processing full-modality data. To address this, we introduced a DPO stage to specifically strengthen the model&#8217;s reasoning ability. In this stage, we reuse rollout samples from the online RL phase under an &#8220;LLM as a Judge&#8221; mechanism, selecting those with a logical reasoning process and accurate outcomes as positive examples. Additionally, for samples that yielded zero accuracy during online training, we leverage closed-source commercial models (Gemini-2.5-Flash) as a teacher to generate high-quality reasoning demonstrations, thereby improving the student model, Uni-MoE 2.0. The GSPO-DPO pipeline supports iterative refinement for progressively stronger reasoning performance.

The results reveal that initial layers exhibit nearly identical routing across tasks, indicating common set of experts for low-level feature extraction. In deeper layers, routing patterns diverge, reflecting task-specific specialization, while the probability of selecting the null expert (Expert 5) decreases sharply, suggesting that computation is increasingly concentrated in semantically critical stages. The activation profiles align with the intended expert roles: Expert 1 dominates vision-centric tasks (Image, Video and omnimodal Understanding), Experts 2 and 3 are prominent in audio-related tasks (Audio and omnimodal Understanding), and Expert 4 consistently contributes across tasks as a general-purpose semantic expert. Notably, understanding tasks show dynamic, layer-dependent routing, implying adaptive allocation of computational resources from concrete to abstract representations. In contrast, generation tasks exhibit stable, uniform routing across layers, consistent with a homogeneous refinement process. These observations confirm that our MoE design effectively promotes functional specialization and learns efficient, task-dependent computation pathways.</p>\n\n",

As a fully open-source omnimodal large model (OLM), it substantially advances Lychee&#8217;s Uni-MoE series in language-centric multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generating. Based on the dense LLM, we build <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni</span> from scratch through three core contributions: dynamic-capacity Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design, a progressive training strategy enhanced with an iterative reinforcement strategy, and a carefully curated multimodal data matching technique. It is capable of omnimodal understanding, as well as generating images, text, and speech.\n<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">Architecturally</span>, our new MoE framework balances computational efficiency and capability for 10 cross-modal inputs using shared, routed, and null experts, while our Omni-Modality 3D RoPE ensures spatio-temporal cross-modality alignment in the self-attention layer.\n<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">For training</span>, following cross-modal pretraining, we use a progressive supervised fine-tuning strategy that activates modality-specific experts and is enhanced by balanced data composition and an iterative GSPO-DPO method to stabilise RL training and improve reasoning.\n<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">Data-wise</span>, the base model, trained on approximately 75B tokens of open-source multimodal data, is equipped with special speech and image generation tokens, allowing it to learn these generative tasks by conditioning its outputs on linguistic cues.\nExtensive evaluation across 85 benchmarks demonstrates that our model achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance against leading OLMs, surpassing Qwen2.5-Omni (trained with 1.2T tokens) on over 50 of 76 benchmarks. Key strengths include video understanding (+7% avg. of 8), omnimodallity understanding (+7% avg. of 4), and audiovisual reasoning (+4%). It also advances long-form speech processing (WER reduced by up to 4.2%) and leads in low-level image processing and controllable generation across 5 metrics.</p>\n\n",

Similar to M-RoPE, we decompose the original rotary embedding into three components corresponding to the temporal, height, and width dimensions. For textual inputs, these components share the same position IDs, rendering Omni-Modality 3D RoPE functionally equivalent to the standard 1D-RoPE. For audio inputs, we align the temporal position IDs with absolute time. Specifically, we define 20 tokens as the minimum temporal unit, which corresponds to a duration of 3 seconds. Instead of adopting the original single-step increment of position IDs, we replace it with the variation rate of absolute time. For image inputs, the temporal IDs of visual tokens remain fixed, while the height and width IDs are assigned according to the spatial locations of tokens within the original image. Unlike M-RoPE, the height and width dimensions are traversed in a patch-wise manner, such that all tokens within a single vision patch are enumerated before proceeding to the next patch.

This is followed by the text content that the model needs to transcribe into speech, which is terminated with the special token &lt;speech end&gt;.

The second stage incorporates a large amount of data with diverse timbres, including two types: data for same-timbre synthesis (where three timbre categories dominate in quantity) and data for stylized custom timbre synthesis (where timbre is controlled via natural language), with a data volume of 5B tokens. In the final stage, training for MoE model activation is conducted using data of the same quantity as the previous stage, resulting in the final version of the MoE-TTS model.</p>\n\n",

The results reveal that initial layers exhibit nearly identical routing across tasks, indicating common set of experts for low-level feature extraction. In deeper layers, routing patterns diverge, reflecting task-specific specialization, while the probability of selecting the null expert (Expert 5) decreases sharply, suggesting that computation is increasingly concentrated in semantically critical stages. The activation profiles align with the intended expert roles: Expert 1 dominates vision-centric tasks (Image, Video and omnimodal Understanding), Experts 2 and 3 are prominent in audio-related tasks (Audio and omnimodal Understanding), and Expert 4 consistently contributes across tasks as a general-purpose semantic expert. Notably, understanding tasks show dynamic, layer-dependent routing, implying adaptive allocation of computational resources from concrete to abstract representations. In contrast, generation tasks exhibit stable, uniform routing across layers, consistent with a homogeneous refinement process. These observations confirm that our MoE design effectively promotes functional specialization and learns efficient, task-dependent computation pathways.</p>\n\n",

A key trend in these middle layers is the steady increase in activation of the null expert (Expert 5), meaning the model learns to skip tokens that no longer need processing at intermediate stages.

Furthermore, smaller (0.5B) autoregressive models struggle with style conversion, a limitation we address by adopting a MoE architecture. For these models, training on token embeddings from a pre-trained base model proves more effective for capturing vocal style than end-to-end training. Together, these approaches form an effective framework for building efficient and expressive neural spoken systems. Building on these insights, our future work will follow Uni-MoE-Audio, using a single tokenizer for both understanding and generation tasks. This foundation will enable cross-modal training with text and video, facilitating context-aware and voice-preserved applications.

Based on the dense LLM, we build <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni</span> from scratch through three core contributions: dynamic-capacity Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design, a progressive training strategy enhanced with an iterative reinforcement strategy, and a carefully curated multimodal data matching technique. It is capable of omnimodal understanding, as well as generating images, text, and speech.\n<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">Architecturally</span>, our new MoE framework balances computational efficiency and capability for 10 cross-modal inputs using shared, routed, and null experts, while our Omni-Modality 3D RoPE ensures spatio-temporal cross-modality alignment in the self-attention layer.\n<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">For training</span>, following cross-modal pretraining, we use a progressive supervised fine-tuning strategy that activates modality-specific experts and is enhanced by balanced data composition and an iterative GSPO-DPO method to stabilise RL training and improve reasoning.\n<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">Data-wise</span>, the base model, trained on approximately 75B tokens of open-source multimodal data, is equipped with special speech and image generation tokens, allowing it to learn these generative tasks by conditioning its outputs on linguistic cues.\nExtensive evaluation across 85 benchmarks demonstrates that our model achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance against leading OLMs, surpassing Qwen2.5-Omni (trained with 1.2T tokens) on over 50 of 76 benchmarks. Key strengths include video understanding (+7% avg. of 8), omnimodallity understanding (+7% avg. of 4), and audiovisual reasoning (+4%). It also advances long-form speech processing (WER reduced by up to 4.2%) and leads in low-level image processing and controllable generation across 5 metrics.</p>\n\n",

For audio inputs, we align the temporal position IDs with absolute time. Specifically, we define 20 tokens as the minimum temporal unit, which corresponds to a duration of 3 seconds. Instead of adopting the original single-step increment of position IDs, we replace it with the variation rate of absolute time. For image inputs, the temporal IDs of visual tokens remain fixed, while the height and width IDs are assigned according to the spatial locations of tokens within the original image.

The cold-start phase aims to stimulate the model&#8217;s foundational reasoning capabilities across multimodal inputs&#8212;including text, images, and video&#8212;while online reinforcement learning enhances the model&#8217;s autonomous exploration and further refines its reasoning under sparse reward signals. However, during training, we observed limited improvement in the accuracy reward, particularly when processing full-modality data. To address this, we introduced a DPO stage to specifically strengthen the model&#8217;s reasoning ability. In this stage, we reuse rollout samples from the online RL phase under an &#8220;LLM as a Judge&#8221; mechanism, selecting those with a logical reasoning process and accurate outcomes as positive examples. Additionally, for samples that yielded zero accuracy during online training, we leverage closed-source commercial models (Gemini-2.5-Flash) as a teacher to generate high-quality reasoning demonstrations, thereby improving the student model, Uni-MoE 2.0.

The cold-start phase aims to stimulate the model&#8217;s foundational reasoning capabilities across multimodal inputs&#8212;including text, images, and video&#8212;while online reinforcement learning enhances the model&#8217;s autonomous exploration and further refines its reasoning under sparse reward signals. However, during training, we observed limited improvement in the accuracy reward, particularly when processing full-modality data. To address this, we introduced a DPO stage to specifically strengthen the model&#8217;s reasoning ability. In this stage, we reuse rollout samples from the online RL phase under an &#8220;LLM as a Judge&#8221; mechanism, selecting those with a logical reasoning process and accurate outcomes as positive examples. Additionally, for samples that yielded zero accuracy during online training, we leverage closed-source commercial models (Gemini-2.5-Flash) as a teacher to generate high-quality reasoning demonstrations, thereby improving the student model, Uni-MoE 2.0. The GSPO-DPO pipeline supports iterative refinement for progressively stronger reasoning performance.

The results reveal that initial layers exhibit nearly identical routing across tasks, indicating common set of experts for low-level feature extraction. In deeper layers, routing patterns diverge, reflecting task-specific specialization, while the probability of selecting the null expert (Expert 5) decreases sharply, suggesting that computation is increasingly concentrated in semantically critical stages. The activation profiles align with the intended expert roles: Expert 1 dominates vision-centric tasks (Image, Video and omnimodal Understanding), Experts 2 and 3 are prominent in audio-related tasks (Audio and omnimodal Understanding), and Expert 4 consistently contributes across tasks as a general-purpose semantic expert. Notably, understanding tasks show dynamic, layer-dependent routing, implying adaptive allocation of computational resources from concrete to abstract representations. In contrast, generation tasks exhibit stable, uniform routing across layers, consistent with a homogeneous refinement process. These observations confirm that our MoE design effectively promotes functional specialization and learns efficient, task-dependent computation pathways.</p>\n\n",

The baseline model, lacking explicit reasoning, frequently generates semantically inconsistent visuals (e.g., a rodent in an arid habitat or apple trees bearing fruit in winter). Conversely, when guided by a step-by-step reasoning chain, the model successfully parses prompts into constituent visual elements&#8212;such as texture, environment, and seasonal context&#8212;resulting in outputs that are precisely aligned with the prompt&#8217;s semantic intent.

We find that while a compact 20 tokens per second suffices for audio representation, generation requires 40 tokens per second to capture fine-grained acoustic details. Furthermore, smaller (0.5B) autoregressive models struggle with style conversion, a limitation we address by adopting a MoE architecture. For these models, training on token embeddings from a pre-trained base model proves more effective for capturing vocal style than end-to-end training. Together, these approaches form an effective framework for building efficient and expressive neural spoken systems. Building on these insights, our future work will follow Uni-MoE-Audio, using a single tokenizer for both understanding and generation tasks. This foundation will enable cross-modal training with text and video, facilitating context-aware and voice-preserved applications. Concurrently, we will optimize our MoE architecture with conditional routing for more efficient and controllable multi-speaker synthesis.</p>\n\n",

These gains suggest the viability of a language-centric training strategy for integrating diverse image processing capabilities.\nIn future work, we will further refine the architecture for image editing and generation, allowing the base model to perceive and interpret such tasks during pre-training. Nevertheless, the iterative diffusion process for image synthesis and editing will remain externalized. This design reflects our view that multi-step temporal modelling (as in diffusion) operates at a fundamentally different temporal granularity compared to single-step next-token prediction.</p>\n\n",

As a fully open-source omnimodal large model (OLM), it substantially advances Lychee&#8217;s Uni-MoE series in language-centric multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generating. Based on the dense LLM, we build <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni</span> from scratch through three core contributions: dynamic-capacity Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design, a progressive training strategy enhanced with an iterative reinforcement strategy, and a carefully curated multimodal data matching technique. It is capable of omnimodal understanding, as well as generating images, text, and speech.\n<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">Architecturally</span>, our new MoE framework balances computational efficiency and capability for 10 cross-modal inputs using shared, routed, and null experts, while our Omni-Modality 3D RoPE ensures spatio-temporal cross-modality alignment in the self-attention layer.\n<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">For training</span>, following cross-modal pretraining, we use a progressive supervised fine-tuning strategy that activates modality-specific experts and is enhanced by balanced data composition and an iterative GSPO-DPO method to stabilise RL training and improve reasoning.\n<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">Data-wise</span>, the base model, trained on approximately 75B tokens of open-source multimodal data, is equipped with special speech and image generation tokens, allowing it to learn these generative tasks by conditioning its outputs on linguistic cues.\nExtensive evaluation across 85 benchmarks demonstrates that our model achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance against leading OLMs, surpassing Qwen2.5-Omni (trained with 1.2T tokens) on over 50 of 76 benchmarks. Key strengths include video understanding (+7% avg. of 8), omnimodallity understanding (+7% avg. of 4), and audiovisual reasoning (+4%). It also advances long-form speech processing (WER reduced by up to 4.2%) and leads in low-level image processing and controllable generation across 5 metrics.</p>\n\n",

For audio inputs, we align the temporal position IDs with absolute time. Specifically, we define 20 tokens as the minimum temporal unit, which corresponds to a duration of 3 seconds. Instead of adopting the original single-step increment of position IDs, we replace it with the variation rate of absolute time.

However, during training, we observed limited improvement in the accuracy reward, particularly when processing full-modality data. To address this, we introduced a DPO stage to specifically strengthen the model&#8217;s reasoning ability. In this stage, we reuse rollout samples from the online RL phase under an &#8220;LLM as a Judge&#8221; mechanism, selecting those with a logical reasoning process and accurate outcomes as positive examples. Additionally, for samples that yielded zero accuracy during online training, we leverage closed-source commercial models (Gemini-2.5-Flash) as a teacher to generate high-quality reasoning demonstrations, thereby improving the student model, Uni-MoE 2.0. The GSPO-DPO pipeline supports iterative refinement for progressively stronger reasoning performance.

The results reveal that initial layers exhibit nearly identical routing across tasks, indicating common set of experts for low-level feature extraction. In deeper layers, routing patterns diverge, reflecting task-specific specialization, while the probability of selecting the null expert (Expert 5) decreases sharply, suggesting that computation is increasingly concentrated in semantically critical stages. The activation profiles align with the intended expert roles: Expert 1 dominates vision-centric tasks (Image, Video and omnimodal Understanding), Experts 2 and 3 are prominent in audio-related tasks (Audio and omnimodal Understanding), and Expert 4 consistently contributes across tasks as a general-purpose semantic expert. Notably, understanding tasks show dynamic, layer-dependent routing, implying adaptive allocation of computational resources from concrete to abstract representations. In contrast, generation tasks exhibit stable, uniform routing across layers, consistent with a homogeneous refinement process. These observations confirm that our MoE design effectively promotes functional specialization and learns efficient, task-dependent computation pathways.</p>\n\n",

We find that while a compact 20 tokens per second suffices for audio representation, generation requires 40 tokens per second to capture fine-grained acoustic details. Furthermore, smaller (0.5B) autoregressive models struggle with style conversion, a limitation we address by adopting a MoE architecture. For these models, training on token embeddings from a pre-trained base model proves more effective for capturing vocal style than end-to-end training. Together, these approaches form an effective framework for building efficient and expressive neural spoken systems. Building on these insights, our future work will follow Uni-MoE-Audio, using a single tokenizer for both understanding and generation tasks. This foundation will enable cross-modal training with text and video, facilitating context-aware and voice-preserved applications.

As a fully open-source omnimodal large model (OLM), it substantially advances Lychee&#8217;s Uni-MoE series in language-centric multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generating. Based on the dense LLM, we build <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni</span> from scratch through three core contributions: dynamic-capacity Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design, a progressive training strategy enhanced with an iterative reinforcement strategy, and a carefully curated multimodal data matching technique. It is capable of omnimodal understanding, as well as generating images, text, and speech.\n<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">Architecturally</span>, our new MoE framework balances computational efficiency and capability for 10 cross-modal inputs using shared, routed, and null experts, while our Omni-Modality 3D RoPE ensures spatio-temporal cross-modality alignment in the self-attention layer.\n<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">For training</span>, following cross-modal pretraining, we use a progressive supervised fine-tuning strategy that activates modality-specific experts and is enhanced by balanced data composition and an iterative GSPO-DPO method to stabilise RL training and improve reasoning.\n<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">Data-wise</span>, the base model, trained on approximately 75B tokens of open-source multimodal data, is equipped with special speech and image generation tokens, allowing it to learn these generative tasks by conditioning its outputs on linguistic cues.\nExtensive evaluation across 85 benchmarks demonstrates that our model achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance against leading OLMs, surpassing Qwen2.5-Omni (trained with 1.2T tokens) on over 50 of 76 benchmarks. Key strengths include video understanding (+7% avg. of 8), omnimodallity understanding (+7% avg. of 4), and audiovisual reasoning (+4%). It also advances long-form speech processing (WER reduced by up to 4.2%) and leads in low-level image processing and controllable generation across 5 metrics.</p>\n\n",

For textual inputs, these components share the same position IDs, rendering Omni-Modality 3D RoPE functionally equivalent to the standard 1D-RoPE. For audio inputs, we align the temporal position IDs with absolute time. Specifically, we define 20 tokens as the minimum temporal unit, which corresponds to a duration of 3 seconds. Instead of adopting the original single-step increment of position IDs, we replace it with the variation rate of absolute time. For image inputs, the temporal IDs of visual tokens remain fixed, while the height and width IDs are assigned according to the spatial locations of tokens within the original image. Unlike M-RoPE, the height and width dimensions are traversed in a patch-wise manner, such that all tokens within a single vision patch are enumerated before proceeding to the next patch.

When the model receives an instruction to generate an audio response, the Uni-MoE base model first produces a special token (i.e. <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">&lt;speech start&gt;</span>) indicating the start of speech, . Subsequently, the model generates commands that specify the voice timbre for audio synthesis: fixed timbres include those of Brain, Jenny, and Xiaoxiao, while supported languages cover Chinese and English. Beyond fixed options, the model also enables users to describe desired timbres via natural language; the MoE-TTS module then generates audio with the corresponding timbre based on these descriptive instructions. Upon completion of the timbre prompt, a special token &lt;speech prompt&gt; is generated to signal the end of the prompt. This is followed by the text content that the model needs to transcribe into speech, which is terminated with the special token &lt;speech end&gt;. Through this combination of text-based timbre prompts and target text content, MoE-TTS is guided to perform diverse timbre synthesis.</p>\n\n",

The cold-start phase aims to stimulate the model&#8217;s foundational reasoning capabilities across multimodal inputs&#8212;including text, images, and video&#8212;while online reinforcement learning enhances the model&#8217;s autonomous exploration and further refines its reasoning under sparse reward signals. However, during training, we observed limited improvement in the accuracy reward, particularly when processing full-modality data. To address this, we introduced a DPO stage to specifically strengthen the model&#8217;s reasoning ability. In this stage, we reuse rollout samples from the online RL phase under an &#8220;LLM as a Judge&#8221; mechanism, selecting those with a logical reasoning process and accurate outcomes as positive examples. Additionally, for samples that yielded zero accuracy during online training, we leverage closed-source commercial models (Gemini-2.5-Flash) as a teacher to generate high-quality reasoning demonstrations, thereby improving the student model, Uni-MoE 2.0.

The activation profiles align with the intended expert roles: Expert 1 dominates vision-centric tasks (Image, Video and omnimodal Understanding), Experts 2 and 3 are prominent in audio-related tasks (Audio and omnimodal Understanding), and Expert 4 consistently contributes across tasks as a general-purpose semantic expert. Notably, understanding tasks show dynamic, layer-dependent routing, implying adaptive allocation of computational resources from concrete to abstract representations. In contrast, generation tasks exhibit stable, uniform routing across layers, consistent with a homogeneous refinement process. These observations confirm that our MoE design effectively promotes functional specialization and learns efficient, task-dependent computation pathways.</p>\n\n",

The distribution follows a distinct peak&#8211;trough&#8211;peak&#8211;fall pattern: high load in early layers (1&#8211;3) for general-purpose feature extraction, a brief reduction in layers 4&#8211;6, a primary peak in middle-to-deep layers (7&#8211;21) corresponding to complex reasoning and feature integration, and a final decline in layers 21&#8211;27 as processing converges to output. While consistent across tasks, modality-specific differences emerge: temporal inputs such as Video and Audio exhibit a stronger initial peak than static Image, with more tokens activating multiple experts, indicating greater parallel resource needs for spatiotemporal processing. These results suggest that the routing mechanism learns both a global computational structure and fine-grained, modality-aware resource allocation.</p>\n\n",

Expert usage remains stable in the shallowest (Layer 0) and deepest (Layer 27) layers, while middle layers (Layers 9 and 18) show clear changes during training. This indicates that most refinement of expert specialization happens in the middle of the network, where both routing patterns and expert parameters are actively optimized. A key trend in these middle layers is the steady increase in activation of the null expert (Expert 5), meaning the model learns to skip tokens that no longer need processing at intermediate stages. This behavior confirms the value of the null expert for efficient computation and shows that our training strategy effectively improves inference efficiency.</p>\n\n",

We find that while a compact 20 tokens per second suffices for audio representation, generation requires 40 tokens per second to capture fine-grained acoustic details. Furthermore, smaller (0.5B) autoregressive models struggle with style conversion, a limitation we address by adopting a MoE architecture. For these models, training on token embeddings from a pre-trained base model proves more effective for capturing vocal style than end-to-end training. Together, these approaches form an effective framework for building efficient and expressive neural spoken systems. Building on these insights, our future work will follow Uni-MoE-Audio, using a single tokenizer for both understanding and generation tasks. This foundation will enable cross-modal training with text and video, facilitating context-aware and voice-preserved applications. Concurrently, we will optimize our MoE architecture with conditional routing for more efficient and controllable multi-speaker synthesis.</p>\n\n",

Notably, Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni achieves remarkable results in several key tasks: in the LlamaQA (s&#8594;s) subtask, it attains an accuracy of 75.33, ranking second only to the top-performing model, which underscores its strong ability to handle speech-to-speech reasoning in this scenario. In the BigBench Audio (s&#8594;s) task, it achieves 44.7, showcasing its robustness in audio-related QA.\nFor some challenging benchmarks, such as MultiChallenge Audio, Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni still maintains a competitive position, indicating its versatility across diverse speech QA scenarios. While there is a performance gap compared to the strongest models like Ming-Lite-Omni on certain tasks, we attribute this to the relatively limited specialized Knowledge QA data during pre-training and the low proportion of such data in subsequent training stages.</p>\n\n"

Based on the dense LLM, we build <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni</span> from scratch through three core contributions: dynamic-capacity Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design, a progressive training strategy enhanced with an iterative reinforcement strategy, and a carefully curated multimodal data matching technique. It is capable of omnimodal understanding, as well as generating images, text, and speech.\n<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">Architecturally</span>, our new MoE framework balances computational efficiency and capability for 10 cross-modal inputs using shared, routed, and null experts, while our Omni-Modality 3D RoPE ensures spatio-temporal cross-modality alignment in the self-attention layer.\n<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">For training</span>, following cross-modal pretraining, we use a progressive supervised fine-tuning strategy that activates modality-specific experts and is enhanced by balanced data composition and an iterative GSPO-DPO method to stabilise RL training and improve reasoning.\n<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">Data-wise</span>, the base model, trained on approximately 75B tokens of open-source multimodal data, is equipped with special speech and image generation tokens, allowing it to learn these generative tasks by conditioning its outputs on linguistic cues.\nExtensive evaluation across 85 benchmarks demonstrates that our model achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance against leading OLMs, surpassing Qwen2.5-Omni (trained with 1.2T tokens) on over 50 of 76 benchmarks. Key strengths include video understanding (+7% avg. of 8), omnimodallity understanding (+7% avg. of 4), and audiovisual reasoning (+4%). It also advances long-form speech processing (WER reduced by up to 4.2%) and leads in low-level image processing and controllable generation across 5 metrics.</p>\n\n",

The training process is divided into two key stages: First, we pre-train three separate dense models, each on a single-speaker TTS dataset to capture a unique vocal style.

Subsequently, the model generates commands that specify the voice timbre for audio synthesis: fixed timbres include those of Brain, Jenny, and Xiaoxiao, while supported languages cover Chinese and English. Beyond fixed options, the model also enables users to describe desired timbres via natural language; the MoE-TTS module then generates audio with the corresponding timbre based on these descriptive instructions.

This is followed by the text content that the model needs to transcribe into speech, which is terminated with the special token &lt;speech end&gt;.

The results reveal that initial layers exhibit nearly identical routing across tasks, indicating common set of experts for low-level feature extraction. In deeper layers, routing patterns diverge, reflecting task-specific specialization, while the probability of selecting the null expert (Expert 5) decreases sharply, suggesting that computation is increasingly concentrated in semantically critical stages. The activation profiles align with the intended expert roles: Expert 1 dominates vision-centric tasks (Image, Video and omnimodal Understanding), Experts 2 and 3 are prominent in audio-related tasks (Audio and omnimodal Understanding), and Expert 4 consistently contributes across tasks as a general-purpose semantic expert. Notably, understanding tasks show dynamic, layer-dependent routing, implying adaptive allocation of computational resources from concrete to abstract representations. In contrast, generation tasks exhibit stable, uniform routing across layers, consistent with a homogeneous refinement process. These observations confirm that our MoE design effectively promotes functional specialization and learns efficient, task-dependent computation pathways.</p>\n\n",

A key trend in these middle layers is the steady increase in activation of the null expert (Expert 5), meaning the model learns to skip tokens that no longer need processing at intermediate stages.

Furthermore, smaller (0.5B) autoregressive models struggle with style conversion, a limitation we address by adopting a MoE architecture. For these models, training on token embeddings from a pre-trained base model proves more effective for capturing vocal style than end-to-end training. Together, these approaches form an effective framework for building efficient and expressive neural spoken systems. Building on these insights, our future work will follow Uni-MoE-Audio, using a single tokenizer for both understanding and generation tasks. This foundation will enable cross-modal training with text and video, facilitating context-aware and voice-preserved applications.

Notably, we explored a progressive model architecture evolution and training strategy optimization, which can extend dense large language models into efficient MoE-based omnimodal large models, achieving a leap from multimodal understanding to both understanding and generation.\nExtensive evaluations across 85 benchmarks confirm that Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni sets a new state-of-the-art or is highly competitive with leading omnimodal large models, demonstrating particular strengths in video understanding, omnimodal comprehension, long speech understanding and generating, audio-visual, controllable image generation, and low-level image restoration tasks. The commitment to open-sourcing the model&#8217;s code, checkpoints, and data ensures transparency and fosters further innovation in the field of multimodal artificial intelligence.</p>\n\n",

This autoregressive module takes input instructions and text tokens to generate the corresponding speech encodings, which are subsequently decoded into waveform audio by the Wavtokenizer decoder. The training process is divided into two key stages: First, we pre-train three separate dense models, each on a single-speaker TTS dataset to capture a unique vocal style. Second, this model is transformed into a MoE architecture by replicating its FFN layers to create four experts, which are then fine-tuned on a diverse, multi-style, and multi-speaker dataset.

Subsequently, the model generates commands that specify the voice timbre for audio synthesis: fixed timbres include those of Brain, Jenny, and Xiaoxiao, while supported languages cover Chinese and English. Beyond fixed options, the model also enables users to describe desired timbres via natural language; the MoE-TTS module then generates audio with the corresponding timbre based on these descriptive instructions. Upon completion of the timbre prompt, a special token &lt;speech prompt&gt; is generated to signal the end of the prompt. This is followed by the text content that the model needs to transcribe into speech, which is terminated with the special token &lt;speech end&gt;. Through this combination of text-based timbre prompts and target text content, MoE-TTS is guided to perform diverse timbre synthesis.</p>\n\n",

However, during training, we observed limited improvement in the accuracy reward, particularly when processing full-modality data. To address this, we introduced a DPO stage to specifically strengthen the model&#8217;s reasoning ability.

The results reveal that initial layers exhibit nearly identical routing across tasks, indicating common set of experts for low-level feature extraction. In deeper layers, routing patterns diverge, reflecting task-specific specialization, while the probability of selecting the null expert (Expert 5) decreases sharply, suggesting that computation is increasingly concentrated in semantically critical stages. The activation profiles align with the intended expert roles: Expert 1 dominates vision-centric tasks (Image, Video and omnimodal Understanding), Experts 2 and 3 are prominent in audio-related tasks (Audio and omnimodal Understanding), and Expert 4 consistently contributes across tasks as a general-purpose semantic expert. Notably, understanding tasks show dynamic, layer-dependent routing, implying adaptive allocation of computational resources from concrete to abstract representations. In contrast, generation tasks exhibit stable, uniform routing across layers, consistent with a homogeneous refinement process. These observations confirm that our MoE design effectively promotes functional specialization and learns efficient, task-dependent computation pathways.</p>\n\n",

We find that while a compact 20 tokens per second suffices for audio representation, generation requires 40 tokens per second to capture fine-grained acoustic details. Furthermore, smaller (0.5B) autoregressive models struggle with style conversion, a limitation we address by adopting a MoE architecture. For these models, training on token embeddings from a pre-trained base model proves more effective for capturing vocal style than end-to-end training. Together, these approaches form an effective framework for building efficient and expressive neural spoken systems. Building on these insights, our future work will follow Uni-MoE-Audio, using a single tokenizer for both understanding and generation tasks. This foundation will enable cross-modal training with text and video, facilitating context-aware and voice-preserved applications. Concurrently, we will optimize our MoE architecture with conditional routing for more efficient and controllable multi-speaker synthesis.</p>\n\n",

These gains suggest the viability of a language-centric training strategy for integrating diverse image processing capabilities.\nIn future work, we will further refine the architecture for image editing and generation, allowing the base model to perceive and interpret such tasks during pre-training. Nevertheless, the iterative diffusion process for image synthesis and editing will remain externalized.

As a fully open-source omnimodal large model (OLM), it substantially advances Lychee&#8217;s Uni-MoE series in language-centric multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generating. Based on the dense LLM, we build <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni</span> from scratch through three core contributions: dynamic-capacity Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design, a progressive training strategy enhanced with an iterative reinforcement strategy, and a carefully curated multimodal data matching technique. It is capable of omnimodal understanding, as well as generating images, text, and speech.\n<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">Architecturally</span>, our new MoE framework balances computational efficiency and capability for 10 cross-modal inputs using shared, routed, and null experts, while our Omni-Modality 3D RoPE ensures spatio-temporal cross-modality alignment in the self-attention layer.\n<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">For training</span>, following cross-modal pretraining, we use a progressive supervised fine-tuning strategy that activates modality-specific experts and is enhanced by balanced data composition and an iterative GSPO-DPO method to stabilise RL training and improve reasoning.\n<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">Data-wise</span>, the base model, trained on approximately 75B tokens of open-source multimodal data, is equipped with special speech and image generation tokens, allowing it to learn these generative tasks by conditioning its outputs on linguistic cues.\nExtensive evaluation across 85 benchmarks demonstrates that our model achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance against leading OLMs, surpassing Qwen2.5-Omni (trained with 1.2T tokens) on over 50 of 76 benchmarks. Key strengths include video understanding (+7% avg. of 8), omnimodallity understanding (+7% avg. of 4), and audiovisual reasoning (+4%). It also advances long-form speech processing (WER reduced by up to 4.2%) and leads in low-level image processing and controllable generation across 5 metrics.</p>\n\n",

Instead of adopting the original single-step increment of position IDs, we replace it with the variation rate of absolute time. For image inputs, the temporal IDs of visual tokens remain fixed, while the height and width IDs are assigned according to the spatial locations of tokens within the original image.

The cold-start phase aims to stimulate the model&#8217;s foundational reasoning capabilities across multimodal inputs&#8212;including text, images, and video&#8212;while online reinforcement learning enhances the model&#8217;s autonomous exploration and further refines its reasoning under sparse reward signals. However, during training, we observed limited improvement in the accuracy reward, particularly when processing full-modality data. To address this, we introduced a DPO stage to specifically strengthen the model&#8217;s reasoning ability. In this stage, we reuse rollout samples from the online RL phase under an &#8220;LLM as a Judge&#8221; mechanism, selecting those with a logical reasoning process and accurate outcomes as positive examples. Additionally, for samples that yielded zero accuracy during online training, we leverage closed-source commercial models (Gemini-2.5-Flash) as a teacher to generate high-quality reasoning demonstrations, thereby improving the student model, Uni-MoE 2.0.

The results reveal that initial layers exhibit nearly identical routing across tasks, indicating common set of experts for low-level feature extraction. In deeper layers, routing patterns diverge, reflecting task-specific specialization, while the probability of selecting the null expert (Expert 5) decreases sharply, suggesting that computation is increasingly concentrated in semantically critical stages. The activation profiles align with the intended expert roles: Expert 1 dominates vision-centric tasks (Image, Video and omnimodal Understanding), Experts 2 and 3 are prominent in audio-related tasks (Audio and omnimodal Understanding), and Expert 4 consistently contributes across tasks as a general-purpose semantic expert. Notably, understanding tasks show dynamic, layer-dependent routing, implying adaptive allocation of computational resources from concrete to abstract representations. In contrast, generation tasks exhibit stable, uniform routing across layers, consistent with a homogeneous refinement process. These observations confirm that our MoE design effectively promotes functional specialization and learns efficient, task-dependent computation pathways.</p>\n\n",

A key trend in these middle layers is the steady increase in activation of the null expert (Expert 5), meaning the model learns to skip tokens that no longer need processing at intermediate stages.

Furthermore, smaller (0.5B) autoregressive models struggle with style conversion, a limitation we address by adopting a MoE architecture. For these models, training on token embeddings from a pre-trained base model proves more effective for capturing vocal style than end-to-end training. Together, these approaches form an effective framework for building efficient and expressive neural spoken systems. Building on these insights, our future work will follow Uni-MoE-Audio, using a single tokenizer for both understanding and generation tasks. This foundation will enable cross-modal training with text and video, facilitating context-aware and voice-preserved applications.

Notably, we explored a progressive model architecture evolution and training strategy optimization, which can extend dense large language models into efficient MoE-based omnimodal large models, achieving a leap from multimodal understanding to both understanding and generation.\nExtensive evaluations across 85 benchmarks confirm that Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni sets a new state-of-the-art or is highly competitive with leading omnimodal large models, demonstrating particular strengths in video understanding, omnimodal comprehension, long speech understanding and generating, audio-visual, controllable image generation, and low-level image restoration tasks. The commitment to open-sourcing the model&#8217;s code, checkpoints, and data ensures transparency and fosters further innovation in the field of multimodal artificial intelligence.</p>\n\n",

Key strengths include video understanding (+7% avg. of 8), omnimodallity understanding (+7% avg. of 4), and audiovisual reasoning (+4%).

For textual inputs, these components share the same position IDs, rendering Omni-Modality 3D RoPE functionally equivalent to the standard 1D-RoPE. For audio inputs, we align the temporal position IDs with absolute time. Specifically, we define 20 tokens as the minimum temporal unit, which corresponds to a duration of 3 seconds. Instead of adopting the original single-step increment of position IDs, we replace it with the variation rate of absolute time. For image inputs, the temporal IDs of visual tokens remain fixed, while the height and width IDs are assigned according to the spatial locations of tokens within the original image. Unlike M-RoPE, the height and width dimensions are traversed in a patch-wise manner, such that all tokens within a single vision patch are enumerated before proceeding to the next patch.

The results reveal that initial layers exhibit nearly identical routing across tasks, indicating common set of experts for low-level feature extraction. In deeper layers, routing patterns diverge, reflecting task-specific specialization, while the probability of selecting the null expert (Expert 5) decreases sharply, suggesting that computation is increasingly concentrated in semantically critical stages. The activation profiles align with the intended expert roles: Expert 1 dominates vision-centric tasks (Image, Video and omnimodal Understanding), Experts 2 and 3 are prominent in audio-related tasks (Audio and omnimodal Understanding), and Expert 4 consistently contributes across tasks as a general-purpose semantic expert. Notably, understanding tasks show dynamic, layer-dependent routing, implying adaptive allocation of computational resources from concrete to abstract representations. In contrast, generation tasks exhibit stable, uniform routing across layers, consistent with a homogeneous refinement process. These observations confirm that our MoE design effectively promotes functional specialization and learns efficient, task-dependent computation pathways.</p>\n\n",

This indicates that most refinement of expert specialization happens in the middle of the network, where both routing patterns and expert parameters are actively optimized. A key trend in these middle layers is the steady increase in activation of the null expert (Expert 5), meaning the model learns to skip tokens that no longer need processing at intermediate stages. This behavior confirms the value of the null expert for efficient computation and shows that our training strategy effectively improves inference efficiency.</p>\n\n",

We find that while a compact 20 tokens per second suffices for audio representation, generation requires 40 tokens per second to capture fine-grained acoustic details. Furthermore, smaller (0.5B) autoregressive models struggle with style conversion, a limitation we address by adopting a MoE architecture. For these models, training on token embeddings from a pre-trained base model proves more effective for capturing vocal style than end-to-end training. Together, these approaches form an effective framework for building efficient and expressive neural spoken systems. Building on these insights, our future work will follow Uni-MoE-Audio, using a single tokenizer for both understanding and generation tasks. This foundation will enable cross-modal training with text and video, facilitating context-aware and voice-preserved applications. Concurrently, we will optimize our MoE architecture with conditional routing for more efficient and controllable multi-speaker synthesis.</p>\n\n",

The cold-start phase aims to stimulate the model&#8217;s foundational reasoning capabilities across multimodal inputs&#8212;including text, images, and video&#8212;while online reinforcement learning enhances the model&#8217;s autonomous exploration and further refines its reasoning under sparse reward signals. However, during training, we observed limited improvement in the accuracy reward, particularly when processing full-modality data. To address this, we introduced a DPO stage to specifically strengthen the model&#8217;s reasoning ability. In this stage, we reuse rollout samples from the online RL phase under an &#8220;LLM as a Judge&#8221; mechanism, selecting those with a logical reasoning process and accurate outcomes as positive examples.

In deeper layers, routing patterns diverge, reflecting task-specific specialization, while the probability of selecting the null expert (Expert 5) decreases sharply, suggesting that computation is increasingly concentrated in semantically critical stages. The activation profiles align with the intended expert roles: Expert 1 dominates vision-centric tasks (Image, Video and omnimodal Understanding), Experts 2 and 3 are prominent in audio-related tasks (Audio and omnimodal Understanding), and Expert 4 consistently contributes across tasks as a general-purpose semantic expert. Notably, understanding tasks show dynamic, layer-dependent routing, implying adaptive allocation of computational resources from concrete to abstract representations. In contrast, generation tasks exhibit stable, uniform routing across layers, consistent with a homogeneous refinement process. These observations confirm that our MoE design effectively promotes functional specialization and learns efficient, task-dependent computation pathways.</p>\n\n",

The distribution follows a distinct peak&#8211;trough&#8211;peak&#8211;fall pattern: high load in early layers (1&#8211;3) for general-purpose feature extraction, a brief reduction in layers 4&#8211;6, a primary peak in middle-to-deep layers (7&#8211;21) corresponding to complex reasoning and feature integration, and a final decline in layers 21&#8211;27 as processing converges to output. While consistent across tasks, modality-specific differences emerge: temporal inputs such as Video and Audio exhibit a stronger initial peak than static Image, with more tokens activating multiple experts, indicating greater parallel resource needs for spatiotemporal processing.

Expert usage remains stable in the shallowest (Layer 0) and deepest (Layer 27) layers, while middle layers (Layers 9 and 18) show clear changes during training. This indicates that most refinement of expert specialization happens in the middle of the network, where both routing patterns and expert parameters are actively optimized. A key trend in these middle layers is the steady increase in activation of the null expert (Expert 5), meaning the model learns to skip tokens that no longer need processing at intermediate stages. This behavior confirms the value of the null expert for efficient computation and shows that our training strategy effectively improves inference efficiency.</p>\n\n",

We find that while a compact 20 tokens per second suffices for audio representation, generation requires 40 tokens per second to capture fine-grained acoustic details. Furthermore, smaller (0.5B) autoregressive models struggle with style conversion, a limitation we address by adopting a MoE architecture. For these models, training on token embeddings from a pre-trained base model proves more effective for capturing vocal style than end-to-end training. Together, these approaches form an effective framework for building efficient and expressive neural spoken systems. Building on these insights, our future work will follow Uni-MoE-Audio, using a single tokenizer for both understanding and generation tasks. This foundation will enable cross-modal training with text and video, facilitating context-aware and voice-preserved applications. Concurrently, we will optimize our MoE architecture with conditional routing for more efficient and controllable multi-speaker synthesis.</p>\n\n",

Similar to M-RoPE, we decompose the original rotary embedding into three components corresponding to the temporal, height, and width dimensions. For textual inputs, these components share the same position IDs, rendering Omni-Modality 3D RoPE functionally equivalent to the standard 1D-RoPE. For audio inputs, we align the temporal position IDs with absolute time. Specifically, we define 20 tokens as the minimum temporal unit, which corresponds to a duration of 3 seconds. Instead of adopting the original single-step increment of position IDs, we replace it with the variation rate of absolute time. For image inputs, the temporal IDs of visual tokens remain fixed, while the height and width IDs are assigned according to the spatial locations of tokens within the original image. Unlike M-RoPE, the height and width dimensions are traversed in a patch-wise manner, such that all tokens within a single vision patch are enumerated before proceeding to the next patch. For video inputs, the temporal IDs of each frame are incremented according to <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_framed ltx_framed_underline\">absolute time</span>, while the height and width components follow the same ID assignment pattern as images.</p>\n\n",

In deeper layers, routing patterns diverge, reflecting task-specific specialization, while the probability of selecting the null expert (Expert 5) decreases sharply, suggesting that computation is increasingly concentrated in semantically critical stages. The activation profiles align with the intended expert roles: Expert 1 dominates vision-centric tasks (Image, Video and omnimodal Understanding), Experts 2 and 3 are prominent in audio-related tasks (Audio and omnimodal Understanding), and Expert 4 consistently contributes across tasks as a general-purpose semantic expert. Notably, understanding tasks show dynamic, layer-dependent routing, implying adaptive allocation of computational resources from concrete to abstract representations.

A key trend in these middle layers is the steady increase in activation of the null expert (Expert 5), meaning the model learns to skip tokens that no longer need processing at intermediate stages.

The baseline model, lacking explicit reasoning, frequently generates semantically inconsistent visuals (e.g., a rodent in an arid habitat or apple trees bearing fruit in winter). Conversely, when guided by a step-by-step reasoning chain, the model successfully parses prompts into constituent visual elements&#8212;such as texture, environment, and seasonal context&#8212;resulting in outputs that are precisely aligned with the prompt&#8217;s semantic intent.

We find that while a compact 20 tokens per second suffices for audio representation, generation requires 40 tokens per second to capture fine-grained acoustic details. Furthermore, smaller (0.5B) autoregressive models struggle with style conversion, a limitation we address by adopting a MoE architecture. For these models, training on token embeddings from a pre-trained base model proves more effective for capturing vocal style than end-to-end training. Together, these approaches form an effective framework for building efficient and expressive neural spoken systems. Building on these insights, our future work will follow Uni-MoE-Audio, using a single tokenizer for both understanding and generation tasks. This foundation will enable cross-modal training with text and video, facilitating context-aware and voice-preserved applications. Concurrently, we will optimize our MoE architecture with conditional routing for more efficient and controllable multi-speaker synthesis.</p>\n\n",

While the current text-to-image performance in automated metrics remains limited&#8212;due to the constrained version of our external diffusion model and the scarcity of text&#8211;image paired data&#8212;we observe notable improvements in image editing and low-level image processing tasks. These gains suggest the viability of a language-centric training strategy for integrating diverse image processing capabilities.\nIn future work, we will further refine the architecture for image editing and generation, allowing the base model to perceive and interpret such tasks during pre-training. Nevertheless, the iterative diffusion process for image synthesis and editing will remain externalized. This design reflects our view that multi-step temporal modelling (as in diffusion) operates at a fundamentally different temporal granularity compared to single-step next-token prediction.</p>\n\n",

Based on the dense LLM, we build <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni</span> from scratch through three core contributions: dynamic-capacity Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design, a progressive training strategy enhanced with an iterative reinforcement strategy, and a carefully curated multimodal data matching technique.

Key strengths include video understanding (+7% avg. of 8), omnimodallity understanding (+7% avg. of 4), and audiovisual reasoning (+4%).

The cold-start phase aims to stimulate the model&#8217;s foundational reasoning capabilities across multimodal inputs&#8212;including text, images, and video&#8212;while online reinforcement learning enhances the model&#8217;s autonomous exploration and further refines its reasoning under sparse reward signals. However, during training, we observed limited improvement in the accuracy reward, particularly when processing full-modality data. To address this, we introduced a DPO stage to specifically strengthen the model&#8217;s reasoning ability. In this stage, we reuse rollout samples from the online RL phase under an &#8220;LLM as a Judge&#8221; mechanism, selecting those with a logical reasoning process and accurate outcomes as positive examples. Additionally, for samples that yielded zero accuracy during online training, we leverage closed-source commercial models (Gemini-2.5-Flash) as a teacher to generate high-quality reasoning demonstrations, thereby improving the student model, Uni-MoE 2.0. The GSPO-DPO pipeline supports iterative refinement for progressively stronger reasoning performance.

The activation profiles align with the intended expert roles: Expert 1 dominates vision-centric tasks (Image, Video and omnimodal Understanding), Experts 2 and 3 are prominent in audio-related tasks (Audio and omnimodal Understanding), and Expert 4 consistently contributes across tasks as a general-purpose semantic expert. Notably, understanding tasks show dynamic, layer-dependent routing, implying adaptive allocation of computational resources from concrete to abstract representations. In contrast, generation tasks exhibit stable, uniform routing across layers, consistent with a homogeneous refinement process.

A key trend in these middle layers is the steady increase in activation of the null expert (Expert 5), meaning the model learns to skip tokens that no longer need processing at intermediate stages.

We find that while a compact 20 tokens per second suffices for audio representation, generation requires 40 tokens per second to capture fine-grained acoustic details. Furthermore, smaller (0.5B) autoregressive models struggle with style conversion, a limitation we address by adopting a MoE architecture. For these models, training on token embeddings from a pre-trained base model proves more effective for capturing vocal style than end-to-end training. Together, these approaches form an effective framework for building efficient and expressive neural spoken systems. Building on these insights, our future work will follow Uni-MoE-Audio, using a single tokenizer for both understanding and generation tasks. This foundation will enable cross-modal training with text and video, facilitating context-aware and voice-preserved applications.

Key strengths include video understanding (+7% avg. of 8), omnimodallity understanding (+7% avg. of 4), and audiovisual reasoning (+4%).

The training process is divided into two key stages: First, we pre-train three separate dense models, each on a single-speaker TTS dataset to capture a unique vocal style.

The cold-start phase aims to stimulate the model&#8217;s foundational reasoning capabilities across multimodal inputs&#8212;including text, images, and video&#8212;while online reinforcement learning enhances the model&#8217;s autonomous exploration and further refines its reasoning under sparse reward signals. However, during training, we observed limited improvement in the accuracy reward, particularly when processing full-modality data. To address this, we introduced a DPO stage to specifically strengthen the model&#8217;s reasoning ability. In this stage, we reuse rollout samples from the online RL phase under an &#8220;LLM as a Judge&#8221; mechanism, selecting those with a logical reasoning process and accurate outcomes as positive examples. Additionally, for samples that yielded zero accuracy during online training, we leverage closed-source commercial models (Gemini-2.5-Flash) as a teacher to generate high-quality reasoning demonstrations, thereby improving the student model, Uni-MoE 2.0.

The activation profiles align with the intended expert roles: Expert 1 dominates vision-centric tasks (Image, Video and omnimodal Understanding), Experts 2 and 3 are prominent in audio-related tasks (Audio and omnimodal Understanding), and Expert 4 consistently contributes across tasks as a general-purpose semantic expert. Notably, understanding tasks show dynamic, layer-dependent routing, implying adaptive allocation of computational resources from concrete to abstract representations. In contrast, generation tasks exhibit stable, uniform routing across layers, consistent with a homogeneous refinement process.

A key trend in these middle layers is the steady increase in activation of the null expert (Expert 5), meaning the model learns to skip tokens that no longer need processing at intermediate stages.

We find that while a compact 20 tokens per second suffices for audio representation, generation requires 40 tokens per second to capture fine-grained acoustic details. Furthermore, smaller (0.5B) autoregressive models struggle with style conversion, a limitation we address by adopting a MoE architecture. For these models, training on token embeddings from a pre-trained base model proves more effective for capturing vocal style than end-to-end training. Together, these approaches form an effective framework for building efficient and expressive neural spoken systems. Building on these insights, our future work will follow Uni-MoE-Audio, using a single tokenizer for both understanding and generation tasks. This foundation will enable cross-modal training with text and video, facilitating context-aware and voice-preserved applications.

To enhance the model&#8217;s comprehension of multimodal data (Sec. <a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2511.12609v2#S2.SS3\" title=\"2.3 Main Architecture &#8227; 2 Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni &#8227; Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni: Scaling Language-Centric Omnimodal Large Model with Advanced MoE, Training and Data\"><span class=\"ltx_text ltx_ref_tag\">2.3</span></a>), we introduce Omni-Modality 3D RoPE, a mechanism that temporally aligns inputs from speech, text, video, and images. Within the MoE layer, we employ diverse experts to enable seamless switching between specialized modules. This is stabilized by null experts to realize a token skipping layer, modal-specific routed experts that ensure balanced training, and enhanced by small-size shared experts (only 1/8 of routed experts) that facilitate cross-modal knowledge transfer. For generation tasks (Sec. <a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2511.12609v2#S2.SS4\" title=\"2.4 Uni-Generation &#8227; 2 Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni &#8227; Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni: Scaling Language-Centric Omnimodal Large Model with Advanced MoE, Training and Data\"><span class=\"ltx_text ltx_ref_tag\">2.4</span></a>), the model utilizes dedicated control tokens. Audio Generation tokens govern language and role attributes, which are leveraged by context-aware MoE-TTS modules. Similarly, Image Generation tokens, composed of task and content instructions, bridge the foundation model to a task-aware diffusion transformer, enabling end-to-end image generation and editing.</p>\n\n",

The cold-start phase aims to stimulate the model&#8217;s foundational reasoning capabilities across multimodal inputs&#8212;including text, images, and video&#8212;while online reinforcement learning enhances the model&#8217;s autonomous exploration and further refines its reasoning under sparse reward signals. However, during training, we observed limited improvement in the accuracy reward, particularly when processing full-modality data. To address this, we introduced a DPO stage to specifically strengthen the model&#8217;s reasoning ability. In this stage, we reuse rollout samples from the online RL phase under an &#8220;LLM as a Judge&#8221; mechanism, selecting those with a logical reasoning process and accurate outcomes as positive examples. Additionally, for samples that yielded zero accuracy during online training, we leverage closed-source commercial models (Gemini-2.5-Flash) as a teacher to generate high-quality reasoning demonstrations, thereby improving the student model, Uni-MoE 2.0.

A key trend in these middle layers is the steady increase in activation of the null expert (Expert 5), meaning the model learns to skip tokens that no longer need processing at intermediate stages.

Furthermore, smaller (0.5B) autoregressive models struggle with style conversion, a limitation we address by adopting a MoE architecture. For these models, training on token embeddings from a pre-trained base model proves more effective for capturing vocal style than end-to-end training. Together, these approaches form an effective framework for building efficient and expressive neural spoken systems. Building on these insights, our future work will follow Uni-MoE-Audio, using a single tokenizer for both understanding and generation tasks. This foundation will enable cross-modal training with text and video, facilitating context-aware and voice-preserved applications.

Notably, we explored a progressive model architecture evolution and training strategy optimization, which can extend dense large language models into efficient MoE-based omnimodal large models, achieving a leap from multimodal understanding to both understanding and generation.\nExtensive evaluations across 85 benchmarks confirm that Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni sets a new state-of-the-art or is highly competitive with leading omnimodal large models, demonstrating particular strengths in video understanding, omnimodal comprehension, long speech understanding and generating, audio-visual, controllable image generation, and low-level image restoration tasks. The commitment to open-sourcing the model&#8217;s code, checkpoints, and data ensures transparency and fosters further innovation in the field of multimodal artificial intelligence.</p>\n\n",

Key strengths include video understanding (+7% avg. of 8), omnimodallity understanding (+7% avg. of 4), and audiovisual reasoning (+4%).

For textual inputs, these components share the same position IDs, rendering Omni-Modality 3D RoPE functionally equivalent to the standard 1D-RoPE. For audio inputs, we align the temporal position IDs with absolute time. Specifically, we define 20 tokens as the minimum temporal unit, which corresponds to a duration of 3 seconds. Instead of adopting the original single-step increment of position IDs, we replace it with the variation rate of absolute time. For image inputs, the temporal IDs of visual tokens remain fixed, while the height and width IDs are assigned according to the spatial locations of tokens within the original image. Unlike M-RoPE, the height and width dimensions are traversed in a patch-wise manner, such that all tokens within a single vision patch are enumerated before proceeding to the next patch.

The cold-start phase aims to stimulate the model&#8217;s foundational reasoning capabilities across multimodal inputs&#8212;including text, images, and video&#8212;while online reinforcement learning enhances the model&#8217;s autonomous exploration and further refines its reasoning under sparse reward signals. However, during training, we observed limited improvement in the accuracy reward, particularly when processing full-modality data. To address this, we introduced a DPO stage to specifically strengthen the model&#8217;s reasoning ability. In this stage, we reuse rollout samples from the online RL phase under an &#8220;LLM as a Judge&#8221; mechanism, selecting those with a logical reasoning process and accurate outcomes as positive examples. Additionally, for samples that yielded zero accuracy during online training, we leverage closed-source commercial models (Gemini-2.5-Flash) as a teacher to generate high-quality reasoning demonstrations, thereby improving the student model, Uni-MoE 2.0. The GSPO-DPO pipeline supports iterative refinement for progressively stronger reasoning performance.

The results reveal that initial layers exhibit nearly identical routing across tasks, indicating common set of experts for low-level feature extraction. In deeper layers, routing patterns diverge, reflecting task-specific specialization, while the probability of selecting the null expert (Expert 5) decreases sharply, suggesting that computation is increasingly concentrated in semantically critical stages. The activation profiles align with the intended expert roles: Expert 1 dominates vision-centric tasks (Image, Video and omnimodal Understanding), Experts 2 and 3 are prominent in audio-related tasks (Audio and omnimodal Understanding), and Expert 4 consistently contributes across tasks as a general-purpose semantic expert. Notably, understanding tasks show dynamic, layer-dependent routing, implying adaptive allocation of computational resources from concrete to abstract representations. In contrast, generation tasks exhibit stable, uniform routing across layers, consistent with a homogeneous refinement process. These observations confirm that our MoE design effectively promotes functional specialization and learns efficient, task-dependent computation pathways.</p>\n\n",

A key trend in these middle layers is the steady increase in activation of the null expert (Expert 5), meaning the model learns to skip tokens that no longer need processing at intermediate stages.

We find that while a compact 20 tokens per second suffices for audio representation, generation requires 40 tokens per second to capture fine-grained acoustic details. Furthermore, smaller (0.5B) autoregressive models struggle with style conversion, a limitation we address by adopting a MoE architecture. For these models, training on token embeddings from a pre-trained base model proves more effective for capturing vocal style than end-to-end training. Together, these approaches form an effective framework for building efficient and expressive neural spoken systems. Building on these insights, our future work will follow Uni-MoE-Audio, using a single tokenizer for both understanding and generation tasks. This foundation will enable cross-modal training with text and video, facilitating context-aware and voice-preserved applications.

            "<p class=\"ltx_p\">To develop the Thinking variant of Uni-MoE 2.0, we adopted a training strategy combining cold-start initialization with online reinforcement learning (GSPO) <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep\">(<span class=\"ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self\">zheng2025groupsequencepolicyoptimization</span>)</cite> and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep\">(<span class=\"ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self\">rafailov2024directpreferenceoptimizationlanguage</span>)</cite>. The cold-start phase aims to stimulate the model&#8217;s foundational reasoning capabilities across multimodal inputs&#8212;including text, images, and video&#8212;while online reinforcement learning enhances the model&#8217;s autonomous exploration and further refines its reasoning under sparse reward signals. However, during training, we observed limited improvement in the accuracy reward, particularly when processing full-modality data. To address this, we introduced a DPO stage to specifically strengthen the model&#8217;s reasoning ability. In this stage, we reuse rollout samples from the online RL phase under an &#8220;LLM as a Judge&#8221; mechanism, selecting those with a logical reasoning process and accurate outcomes as positive examples. Additionally, for samples that yielded zero accuracy during online training, we leverage closed-source commercial models (Gemini-2.5-Flash) as a teacher to generate high-quality reasoning demonstrations, thereby improving the student model, Uni-MoE 2.0. The GSPO-DPO pipeline supports iterative refinement for progressively stronger reasoning performance. A comprehensive treatment of this iterative optimization strategy and associated experimental analysis is provided in VIPO-R1<span class=\"ltx_note ltx_role_footnote\" id=\"footnote2\"><sup class=\"ltx_note_mark\">2</sup><span class=\"ltx_note_outer\"><span class=\"ltx_note_content\"><sup class=\"ltx_note_mark\">2</sup><span class=\"ltx_tag ltx_tag_note\">2</span>Iterative Policy Optimization: <a class=\"ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter\" href=\"https://github.com/HITsz-TMG/VerIPO\" title=\"\">https://github.com/HITsz-TMG/VerIPO</a></span></span></span> <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep\">(<span class=\"ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self\">li2025veripo</span>)</cite>.

Key strengths include video understanding (+7% avg. of 8), omnimodallity understanding (+7% avg. of 4), and audiovisual reasoning (+4%).

The activation profiles align with the intended expert roles: Expert 1 dominates vision-centric tasks (Image, Video and omnimodal Understanding), Experts 2 and 3 are prominent in audio-related tasks (Audio and omnimodal Understanding), and Expert 4 consistently contributes across tasks as a general-purpose semantic expert. Notably, understanding tasks show dynamic, layer-dependent routing, implying adaptive allocation of computational resources from concrete to abstract representations. In contrast, generation tasks exhibit stable, uniform routing across layers, consistent with a homogeneous refinement process.

A key trend in these middle layers is the steady increase in activation of the null expert (Expert 5), meaning the model learns to skip tokens that no longer need processing at intermediate stages.

Furthermore, smaller (0.5B) autoregressive models struggle with style conversion, a limitation we address by adopting a MoE architecture. For these models, training on token embeddings from a pre-trained base model proves more effective for capturing vocal style than end-to-end training. Together, these approaches form an effective framework for building efficient and expressive neural spoken systems. Building on these insights, our future work will follow Uni-MoE-Audio, using a single tokenizer for both understanding and generation tasks.

As a fully open-source omnimodal large model (OLM), it substantially advances Lychee&#8217;s Uni-MoE series in language-centric multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generating. Based on the dense LLM, we build <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni</span> from scratch through three core contributions: dynamic-capacity Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design, a progressive training strategy enhanced with an iterative reinforcement strategy, and a carefully curated multimodal data matching technique. It is capable of omnimodal understanding, as well as generating images, text, and speech.\n<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">Architecturally</span>, our new MoE framework balances computational efficiency and capability for 10 cross-modal inputs using shared, routed, and null experts, while our Omni-Modality 3D RoPE ensures spatio-temporal cross-modality alignment in the self-attention layer.\n<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">For training</span>, following cross-modal pretraining, we use a progressive supervised fine-tuning strategy that activates modality-specific experts and is enhanced by balanced data composition and an iterative GSPO-DPO method to stabilise RL training and improve reasoning.\n<span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">Data-wise</span>, the base model, trained on approximately 75B tokens of open-source multimodal data, is equipped with special speech and image generation tokens, allowing it to learn these generative tasks by conditioning its outputs on linguistic cues.\nExtensive evaluation across 85 benchmarks demonstrates that our model achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance against leading OLMs, surpassing Qwen2.5-Omni (trained with 1.2T tokens) on over 50 of 76 benchmarks. Key strengths include video understanding (+7% avg. of 8), omnimodallity understanding (+7% avg. of 4), and audiovisual reasoning (+4%). It also advances long-form speech processing (WER reduced by up to 4.2%) and leads in low-level image processing and controllable generation across 5 metrics.</p>\n\n",

Similar to M-RoPE, we decompose the original rotary embedding into three components corresponding to the temporal, height, and width dimensions. For textual inputs, these components share the same position IDs, rendering Omni-Modality 3D RoPE functionally equivalent to the standard 1D-RoPE. For audio inputs, we align the temporal position IDs with absolute time. Specifically, we define 20 tokens as the minimum temporal unit, which corresponds to a duration of 3 seconds. Instead of adopting the original single-step increment of position IDs, we replace it with the variation rate of absolute time. For image inputs, the temporal IDs of visual tokens remain fixed, while the height and width IDs are assigned according to the spatial locations of tokens within the original image. Unlike M-RoPE, the height and width dimensions are traversed in a patch-wise manner, such that all tokens within a single vision patch are enumerated before proceeding to the next patch.

Beyond fixed options, the model also enables users to describe desired timbres via natural language; the MoE-TTS module then generates audio with the corresponding timbre based on these descriptive instructions. Upon completion of the timbre prompt, a special token &lt;speech prompt&gt; is generated to signal the end of the prompt. This is followed by the text content that the model needs to transcribe into speech, which is terminated with the special token &lt;speech end&gt;.

The cold-start phase aims to stimulate the model&#8217;s foundational reasoning capabilities across multimodal inputs&#8212;including text, images, and video&#8212;while online reinforcement learning enhances the model&#8217;s autonomous exploration and further refines its reasoning under sparse reward signals. However, during training, we observed limited improvement in the accuracy reward, particularly when processing full-modality data. To address this, we introduced a DPO stage to specifically strengthen the model&#8217;s reasoning ability. In this stage, we reuse rollout samples from the online RL phase under an &#8220;LLM as a Judge&#8221; mechanism, selecting those with a logical reasoning process and accurate outcomes as positive examples. Additionally, for samples that yielded zero accuracy during online training, we leverage closed-source commercial models (Gemini-2.5-Flash) as a teacher to generate high-quality reasoning demonstrations, thereby improving the student model, Uni-MoE 2.0. The GSPO-DPO pipeline supports iterative refinement for progressively stronger reasoning performance.

In deeper layers, routing patterns diverge, reflecting task-specific specialization, while the probability of selecting the null expert (Expert 5) decreases sharply, suggesting that computation is increasingly concentrated in semantically critical stages. The activation profiles align with the intended expert roles: Expert 1 dominates vision-centric tasks (Image, Video and omnimodal Understanding), Experts 2 and 3 are prominent in audio-related tasks (Audio and omnimodal Understanding), and Expert 4 consistently contributes across tasks as a general-purpose semantic expert. Notably, understanding tasks show dynamic, layer-dependent routing, implying adaptive allocation of computational resources from concrete to abstract representations. In contrast, generation tasks exhibit stable, uniform routing across layers, consistent with a homogeneous refinement process.

While consistent across tasks, modality-specific differences emerge: temporal inputs such as Video and Audio exhibit a stronger initial peak than static Image, with more tokens activating multiple experts, indicating greater parallel resource needs for spatiotemporal processing. These results suggest that the routing mechanism learns both a global computational structure and fine-grained, modality-aware resource allocation.</p>\n\n",

We find that while a compact 20 tokens per second suffices for audio representation, generation requires 40 tokens per second to capture fine-grained acoustic details. Furthermore, smaller (0.5B) autoregressive models struggle with style conversion, a limitation we address by adopting a MoE architecture. For these models, training on token embeddings from a pre-trained base model proves more effective for capturing vocal style than end-to-end training. Together, these approaches form an effective framework for building efficient and expressive neural spoken systems. Building on these insights, our future work will follow Uni-MoE-Audio, using a single tokenizer for both understanding and generation tasks. This foundation will enable cross-modal training with text and video, facilitating context-aware and voice-preserved applications. Concurrently, we will optimize our MoE architecture with conditional routing for more efficient and controllable multi-speaker synthesis.</p>\n\n",
