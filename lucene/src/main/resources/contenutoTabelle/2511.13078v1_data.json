The Med-Math module then takes the quantity from header 3, using concentration to determine Task 4) dosage prescription. Medicine names undergo a dictionary check to infer Task 5) patient&#8217;s disease history. Both OCR and barcode scanner are needed because we find medicine labels may not always contain both names and barcodes. Complementing the outputs from both pipelines ensures EMSGlass can always extract the desired information. Finally, recommendations of all five tasks are continuously updated on the display of the glasses.

We use TinyBERT, MobileBERT, and BERTBase for the symptom text encoder as they have demonstrated success in encoding text data, including EMS texts&#160;<cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep\">(<span class=\"ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self\">CognitiveEMS2024IoTDI</span>; <span class=\"ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self\">EMSAssist2023MobiSys</span>; <span class=\"ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self\">devlin2019bert</span>)</cite>. RNN, LSTM, and GRU are employed for time-series vitals data. A fully-connect (FC) operator is applied to encode the one-hot vector from the object detection model. To fuse multimodal features, we use a feature concatenator to concatenate three encoders&#8217; output vectors into one longer vector. We also tried other feature fusion methods, including dot product, weighted sum, weighted concatenation, and attention. We ultimately choose concatenation due to its higher accuracy on the multimodal EMS dataset. Headers 1 and 2 are standard one-layer classification headers while header 3 is a standard regression header. For simplicity, in this paper, we call the collection of the feature concatenator and three headers as headers.</p>\n\n",

Introduction &#8227; A Smart-Glasses for Emergency Medical Services via Multimodal Multitask Learning\"><span class=\"ltx_text ltx_ref_tag\">1</span></a> illustrates the workflow of an EMT in a typical EMS scenario. The EMT first assesses the patient&#8217;s symptoms, then uses medical equipment to obtain vital signs, and finally evaluates the surrounding environment. These multimodal data&#8211;symptoms, vitals, and images in the scene contexts including alcohol and pills&#8211;are asynchronously collected and processed in sequence to inform real-time clinical decision-making. As these multimodal data arrived (i.e., perceived by EMTs) at different timestamps, one of the critical tasks for EMTs is to select the appropriate EMS protocol from over 100 available options, which requires matching the asynchronously observed multimodal data with that defined in each protocol. For example, in Figure&#160;<a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2511.13078v1#acmlabel1\" title=\"Figure 1 &#8227; 1.

For instance, components incorporating BERTBase exhibit inference times nearly identical to BERTBase itself, with similar trends for TinyBERT and MobileBERT. In contrast, vitals submodules (RNN, GRU, LSTM) and headers require substantially less processing time, underscoring the inefficiency challenge of repeated text submodule computations highlighted in Insight 1.</p>\n\n",

Google Glass, with limited computing power, presents the highest latency, while Edge-64X, with ample resources, is the fastest. For instance, YOLO11n inference takes 3.2s on Google Glass, 0.7s on PH1, 0.08s on Edge-4C, and just 0.03s on Edge-64X. This disparity implies an opportunity for latency reduction through edge-assisted workload offloading. Offloading YOLO11n from Google Glass to Edge-64X achieves over 100&#215; speedup. EMSServe exploits this by offloading high-latency tasks, such as text module inference and object detection, to edge servers.</p>\n\n",

However, without PMI, these smaller models struggle with achieving high accuracy. For example, the TinyBERT-GRU-FC&#8217;s top-1 accuracy is as low as 0.64 while its PMI-enabled version reaches the highest 0.7. Furthermore, given the small 3-modal dataset size in D2, the MobileBERT-GRU-FC generates random numbers in its top-3 protocol recommendation outputs, resulting in zero accuracy for three simultaneous tasks (P-M-Q). In contrast, PMI helps MobileBERT-GRU-FC&#8217;s accuracy reach 0.7, which is the highest for the same metric. This indicates PMI&#8217;s potential in increasing small models&#8217; multimodal capability, especially when the dataset size of different modalities is highly imbalanced (123,803 samples in D1, 3005 in D2). As one of the future works, this potential can be further explored and generalized when smaller multimodal on-device models are needed while the size of data modalities is imbalanced.</p>\n\n",

In contrast, the mAP of all YOLO11 models on images annotated with Grounding Dino is below 0.6, which is unacceptable. The high mAP on the validate set but low mAP and recall on the test set means fine-tuning YOLO11 with Grounding Dino&#8217;s annotations causes the overfitting during the fine-tuning process.

By optimizing multimodal inference execution in EMS scenarios, EMSServe achieves <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">1.9&#215; &#8211; 11.7&#215;</span> speedup over direct PyTorch multimodal inference.\nA user study evaluation with six professional EMTs demonstrates that EMSGlass enhances real-time situational awareness, decision-making speed, and operational efficiency through intuitive on-glass interaction. In addition, qualitative insights from the user study provide actionable directions for extending EMSGlass toward next-generation AI-enabled EMS systems, bridging multimodal intelligence with real-world emergency response workflows.</p>\n\n",

To monitor this variation in real-time, we implement a lightweight heartbeat monitor on the smart glasses, periodically (e.g., every second) measuring the file transmission bandwidth <math alttext=\"\\Delta t=BW*filesize\" class=\"ltx_Math\" display=\"inline\" id=\"S4.SS2.SSS3.p1.m1\" intent=\":literal\"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&#916;</mi><mo lspace=\"0em\" rspace=\"0em\">&#8203;</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>B</mi><mo lspace=\"0em\" rspace=\"0em\">&#8203;</mo><mi>W</mi></mrow><mo lspace=\"0.222em\" rspace=\"0.222em\">&#8727;</mo><mi>f</mi></mrow><mo lspace=\"0em\" rspace=\"0em\">&#8203;</mo><mi>i</mi><mo lspace=\"0em\" rspace=\"0em\">&#8203;</mo><mi>l</mi><mo lspace=\"0em\" rspace=\"0em\">&#8203;</mo><mi>e</mi><mo lspace=\"0em\" rspace=\"0em\">&#8203;</mo><mi>s</mi><mo lspace=\"0em\" rspace=\"0em\">&#8203;</mo><mi>i</mi><mo lspace=\"0em\" rspace=\"0em\">&#8203;</mo><mi>z</mi><mo lspace=\"0em\" rspace=\"0em\">&#8203;</mo><mi>e</mi></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\Delta t=BW*filesize</annotation></semantics></math>.

We put the Google Glass at static distances (0-30 meters) to the Edge-4C in a building. This scenario #2 reflects a typical EMS realism, where the EMTs wearing smart glasses and the EMTs carrying the manpack collaboratively search for patients and perform EMS interventions in different indoor rooms. Figure&#160;<a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2511.13078v1#S5.F15\" title=\"Figure 15 &#8227; 5.2.1. Evaluation plan &#8227; 5.2. Evaluation of EMSServe &#8227; 5.

As we increase the distances, offloading the symptom speech or vitals produces similar cumulative inference latencies while offloading the 10 images tells the essence of offloading in EMS scenarios: it&#8217;s more advantageous to offload images to Edge-4C when the distances are long(e.g., &#191;5m). This is mainly because the size of images used in the episode is relatively large, making offloading images sensitive to the glass-edge distances.</p>\n\n",

Following up with scenario #2 discussed above, a user wearing Google Glass walks from 0m to 30m and then walks back from 30m to 0m, evaluating the adaptive offloading enabled by the latency monitor thread in EMSServe. This is important because, as discussed in Section&#160;<a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2511.13078v1#S1\" title=\"1. Introduction &#8227; A Smart-Glasses for Emergency Medical Services via Multimodal Multitask Learning\"><span class=\"ltx_text ltx_ref_tag\">1</span></a>, seamless EMS recommendations on the UI display require lower inference latencies while the user moves in EMS scenes.

Both figures illustrate that decisions on offloading vitals are not sensitive to mobility due to the fast vitals inference on Google Glass. In (b), with automatic on-glass inference enabled by our adaptive offloading design, where image8 distinguishes the adaptive and nonadaptive offloading options, where the adaptive offloading provides lower model serving latency. In (c), the speech arrives at 30m. While the EMT walks towards Edge-4C, the vitals and images arrive in sequence. When the distance is relatively long (image1-image4), the offloading options achieve comparable cumulative serving latency to on-glass options. When the wireless network becomes unstable (image5), the advantage of adaptively choosing on-glass serving becomes prominent, leaving an obvious gap between non-adaptive and adaptive serving.</p>\n\n",

Participants were then guided through a demonstration scenario showing how EMSGlass transcribes symptoms, displays real-time vitals, detects scene objects (e.g., pills, alcohol bottles), and recommends corresponding EMS protocols, medicines, and dosages. Following the demonstration, participants performed a full simulation independently, interacting with the app to assess a manikin patient by describing symptoms, observing dynamic updates in vitals and recommendations, and completing the scenario by scanning medication labels. Each participant could repeat dry runs until comfortable with the workflow.

Introduction &#8227; A Smart-Glasses for Emergency Medical Services via Multimodal Multitask Learning\"><span class=\"ltx_text ltx_ref_tag\">1</span></a> illustrates the workflow of an EMT in a typical EMS scenario. The EMT first assesses the patient&#8217;s symptoms, then uses medical equipment to obtain vital signs, and finally evaluates the surrounding environment. These multimodal data&#8211;symptoms, vitals, and images in the scene contexts including alcohol and pills&#8211;are asynchronously collected and processed in sequence to inform real-time clinical decision-making. As these multimodal data arrived (i.e., perceived by EMTs) at different timestamps, one of the critical tasks for EMTs is to select the appropriate EMS protocol from over 100 available options, which requires matching the asynchronously observed multimodal data with that defined in each protocol. For example, in Figure&#160;<a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2511.13078v1#acmlabel1\" title=\"Figure 1 &#8227; 1.

The Med-Math module then takes the quantity from header 3, using concentration to determine Task 4) dosage prescription. Medicine names undergo a dictionary check to infer Task 5) patient&#8217;s disease history. Both OCR and barcode scanner are needed because we find medicine labels may not always contain both names and barcodes. Complementing the outputs from both pipelines ensures EMSGlass can always extract the desired information. Finally, recommendations of all five tasks are continuously updated on the display of the glasses.

We also tried other feature fusion methods, including dot product, weighted sum, weighted concatenation, and attention. We ultimately choose concatenation due to its higher accuracy on the multimodal EMS dataset.

There are two rounds of annotations: in the first round, we feed unlabeled EMS scene images D4(image) to GD to get bounding box labels. In the second round, instead of annotating from scratch, we adjust GD&#8217;s annotations from the first round (e.g., relabel GD&#8217;s incorrect annotations). After two rounds, we fine-tune the close-set YOLO11. When compared to conventional manual annotation without GD&#8217;s auto-labeling process, our HITL annotation adjustment saves the annotation time by exploiting the correct annotations from GD and leaves the main manual efforts in GD&#8217;s incorrect or missed annotations.

For the medicine quantity recommendation task (Q and P-M-Q), although fine-tuning w/o PMI seems more performant, fine-tuning w/ PMI achieves comparable performance. For example, fine-tuning with PMI enables TinyBERT-LSTM-FC to achieve the MSE of 1.89 on the single Q task, close to the lowest MSE of 1.87.

However, without PMI, these smaller models struggle with achieving high accuracy. For example, the TinyBERT-GRU-FC&#8217;s top-1 accuracy is as low as 0.64 while its PMI-enabled version reaches the highest 0.7. Furthermore, given the small 3-modal dataset size in D2, the MobileBERT-GRU-FC generates random numbers in its top-3 protocol recommendation outputs, resulting in zero accuracy for three simultaneous tasks (P-M-Q). In contrast, PMI helps MobileBERT-GRU-FC&#8217;s accuracy reach 0.7, which is the highest for the same metric. This indicates PMI&#8217;s potential in increasing small models&#8217; multimodal capability, especially when the dataset size of different modalities is highly imbalanced (123,803 samples in D1, 3005 in D2). As one of the future works, this potential can be further explored and generalized when smaller multimodal on-device models are needed while the size of data modalities is imbalanced.</p>\n\n",

As a WER of 0.1 is generally regarded as the error standard for usable voice assistants&#160;<cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep\">(<span class=\"ltx_ref ltx_missing_citation ltx_ref_self\">MSTestAccMSLearn2024</span>)</cite>, SOTA models struggle with data distribution shifts, with the test set WER exceeding 0.1 due to varying accents and microphone hardware. This challenge is even more critical in EMS settings, where stricter WER requirements render SOTA models impractical for EMS scenarios, further accrediting EMSWhisper&#8217;s ultra-low error rates. Moreover, EMSWhisper, including the Whisper-s and Whisper-m motivated by the scaling law, exhibits exceptional generalization with lower WER variance across users (Figure&#160;<a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2511.13078v1#S5.F11\" title=\"Figure 11 &#8227; 5.1.3.

Our HITL annotation strategy outperforms Grounding Dino&#8217;s annotations, bringing the test mAP value close to 0.8. In contrast, the mAP of all YOLO11 models on images annotated with Grounding Dino is below 0.6, which is unacceptable. The high mAP on the validate set but low mAP and recall on the test set means fine-tuning YOLO11 with Grounding Dino&#8217;s annotations causes the overfitting during the fine-tuning process. For example, using Grounding Dino with the hard text prompts from Figure&#160;<a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2511.13078v1#S3.F5\" title=\"Figure 5 &#8227; 3.3.2.

The recall metric is similar: high validate recall while much lower test recall. This results from Grounding Dino&#8217;s high false positive predictions as discussed in Section&#160;<a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2511.13078v1#S2\" title=\"2.

Our HITL avoids this problem because we add the human adjustments to correct Grounding Dino&#8217;s false positive annotations, enabling much higher test mAP and recall. It&#8217;s important to note that when compared to direct manual annotations,\nthe advantage of our HITL is that we exploit Grounding Dino&#8217;s accurate (i.e., true positives) annotations to save human labor time on annotations.</p>\n\n",

Introduction &#8227; A Smart-Glasses for Emergency Medical Services via Multimodal Multitask Learning\"><span class=\"ltx_text ltx_ref_tag\">1</span></a> illustrates the workflow of an EMT in a typical EMS scenario. The EMT first assesses the patient&#8217;s symptoms, then uses medical equipment to obtain vital signs, and finally evaluates the surrounding environment. These multimodal data&#8211;symptoms, vitals, and images in the scene contexts including alcohol and pills&#8211;are asynchronously collected and processed in sequence to inform real-time clinical decision-making. As these multimodal data arrived (i.e., perceived by EMTs) at different timestamps, one of the critical tasks for EMTs is to select the appropriate EMS protocol from over 100 available options, which requires matching the asynchronously observed multimodal data with that defined in each protocol. For example, in Figure&#160;<a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2511.13078v1#acmlabel1\" title=\"Figure 1 &#8227; 1. Introduction &#8227; A Smart-Glasses for Emergency Medical Services via Multimodal Multitask Learning\"><span class=\"ltx_text ltx_ref_tag\">1</span></a>, after analyzing the asynchronously perceived multimodal data, the EMT selects the protocol &#8220;Medical-Respiratory,&#8221; which prescribes general clinical interventions including the administration of Atrovent medicine at a quantity of 0.5mg. Making such high-stakes clinical decisions under time constraints is critical for optimal EMS delivery but remains a significant challenge for EMTs.</p>\n\n",

The Med-Math module then takes the quantity from header 3, using concentration to determine Task 4) dosage prescription. Medicine names undergo a dictionary check to infer Task 5) patient&#8217;s disease history. Both OCR and barcode scanner are needed because we find medicine labels may not always contain both names and barcodes. Complementing the outputs from both pipelines ensures EMSGlass can always extract the desired information. Finally, recommendations of all five tasks are continuously updated on the display of the glasses.

In the second round, instead of annotating from scratch, we adjust GD&#8217;s annotations from the first round (e.g., relabel GD&#8217;s incorrect annotations). After two rounds, we fine-tune the close-set YOLO11. When compared to conventional manual annotation without GD&#8217;s auto-labeling process, our HITL annotation adjustment saves the annotation time by exploiting the correct annotations from GD and leaves the main manual efforts in GD&#8217;s incorrect or missed annotations. From our experiences, this HITL annotation adjustment method decreases the annotation time by half, e.g., on average, from 10 to 5 minutes for every 100 images.</p>\n\n",

For instance, components incorporating BERTBase exhibit inference times nearly identical to BERTBase itself, with similar trends for TinyBERT and MobileBERT. In contrast, vitals submodules (RNN, GRU, LSTM) and headers require substantially less processing time, underscoring the inefficiency challenge of repeated text submodule computations highlighted in Insight 1.</p>\n\n",

Google Glass, with limited computing power, presents the highest latency, while Edge-64X, with ample resources, is the fastest. For instance, YOLO11n inference takes 3.2s on Google Glass, 0.7s on PH1, 0.08s on Edge-4C, and just 0.03s on Edge-64X. This disparity implies an opportunity for latency reduction through edge-assisted workload offloading. Offloading YOLO11n from Google Glass to Edge-64X achieves over 100&#215; speedup. EMSServe exploits this by offloading high-latency tasks, such as text module inference and object detection, to edge servers.</p>\n\n",

For example, the TinyBERT-GRU-FC&#8217;s top-1 accuracy is as low as 0.64 while its PMI-enabled version reaches the highest 0.7. Furthermore, given the small 3-modal dataset size in D2, the MobileBERT-GRU-FC generates random numbers in its top-3 protocol recommendation outputs, resulting in zero accuracy for three simultaneous tasks (P-M-Q).

In contrast, the mAP of all YOLO11 models on images annotated with Grounding Dino is below 0.6, which is unacceptable. The high mAP on the validate set but low mAP and recall on the test set means fine-tuning YOLO11 with Grounding Dino&#8217;s annotations causes the overfitting during the fine-tuning process.

Directly using PyTorch for multimodal inference on mobile devices and edge servers linearly increases cumulative inference time costs. In contrast, our EMSServe demonstrates much better scalability, incurring minimal cumulative inference time increments in all episodes. This is because the conventional multimodal serving framework repeats text module computation across a whole episode. With the modality-aware splitter splitting the text module and other modal modules apart, EMSServe can cache the text features after processing early arrived symptom speech, and reuse the text feature cache with lately arrived data for subsequent multimodal inference. This avoids repeated text feature cache computations in EMS scenarios where different data arrives asynchronously, achieving 1.9&#215; &#8211; 11.7&#215; speedup on all hardware platforms. In real-world deployments where the length of an episode is longer (e.g., unlimited images in video streaming), EMSServe&#8217;s advantage will be more prominent.</p>\n\n",

Following up with scenario #2 discussed above, a user wearing Google Glass walks from 0m to 30m and then walks back from 30m to 0m, evaluating the adaptive offloading enabled by the latency monitor thread in EMSServe. This is important because, as discussed in Section&#160;<a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2511.13078v1#S1\" title=\"1. Introduction &#8227; A Smart-Glasses for Emergency Medical Services via Multimodal Multitask Learning\"><span class=\"ltx_text ltx_ref_tag\">1</span></a>, seamless EMS recommendations on the UI display require lower inference latencies while the user moves in EMS scenes.

Both figures illustrate that decisions on offloading vitals are not sensitive to mobility due to the fast vitals inference on Google Glass. In (b), with automatic on-glass inference enabled by our adaptive offloading design, where image8 distinguishes the adaptive and nonadaptive offloading options, where the adaptive offloading provides lower model serving latency. In (c), the speech arrives at 30m. While the EMT walks towards Edge-4C, the vitals and images arrive in sequence. When the distance is relatively long (image1-image4), the offloading options achieve comparable cumulative serving latency to on-glass options. When the wireless network becomes unstable (image5), the advantage of adaptively choosing on-glass serving becomes prominent, leaving an obvious gap between non-adaptive and adaptive serving.</p>\n\n",

Introduction &#8227; A Smart-Glasses for Emergency Medical Services via Multimodal Multitask Learning\"><span class=\"ltx_text ltx_ref_tag\">1</span></a> illustrates the workflow of an EMT in a typical EMS scenario. The EMT first assesses the patient&#8217;s symptoms, then uses medical equipment to obtain vital signs, and finally evaluates the surrounding environment. These multimodal data&#8211;symptoms, vitals, and images in the scene contexts including alcohol and pills&#8211;are asynchronously collected and processed in sequence to inform real-time clinical decision-making. As these multimodal data arrived (i.e., perceived by EMTs) at different timestamps, one of the critical tasks for EMTs is to select the appropriate EMS protocol from over 100 available options, which requires matching the asynchronously observed multimodal data with that defined in each protocol. For example, in Figure&#160;<a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2511.13078v1#acmlabel1\" title=\"Figure 1 &#8227; 1. Introduction &#8227; A Smart-Glasses for Emergency Medical Services via Multimodal Multitask Learning\"><span class=\"ltx_text ltx_ref_tag\">1</span></a>, after analyzing the asynchronously perceived multimodal data, the EMT selects the protocol &#8220;Medical-Respiratory,&#8221; which prescribes general clinical interventions including the administration of Atrovent medicine at a quantity of 0.5mg.

The Med-Math module then takes the quantity from header 3, using concentration to determine Task 4) dosage prescription. Medicine names undergo a dictionary check to infer Task 5) patient&#8217;s disease history. Both OCR and barcode scanner are needed because we find medicine labels may not always contain both names and barcodes. Complementing the outputs from both pipelines ensures EMSGlass can always extract the desired information. Finally, recommendations of all five tasks are continuously updated on the display of the glasses.

We also tried other feature fusion methods, including dot product, weighted sum, weighted concatenation, and attention. We ultimately choose concatenation due to its higher accuracy on the multimodal EMS dataset.

There are two rounds of annotations: in the first round, we feed unlabeled EMS scene images D4(image) to GD to get bounding box labels. In the second round, instead of annotating from scratch, we adjust GD&#8217;s annotations from the first round (e.g., relabel GD&#8217;s incorrect annotations). After two rounds, we fine-tune the close-set YOLO11. When compared to conventional manual annotation without GD&#8217;s auto-labeling process, our HITL annotation adjustment saves the annotation time by exploiting the correct annotations from GD and leaves the main manual efforts in GD&#8217;s incorrect or missed annotations. From our experiences, this HITL annotation adjustment method decreases the annotation time by half, e.g., on average, from 10 to 5 minutes for every 100 images.</p>\n\n",

Whisper variants, the speech-to-text models, require significantly more inference time than other components. Whisper-small and Whisper-medium, the largest models, are the slowest on edge servers and are entirely unusable on PH1 and Google Glass due to memory limitations. Additionally, text encoders further exacerbate latency. For instance, components incorporating BERTBase exhibit inference times nearly identical to BERTBase itself, with similar trends for TinyBERT and MobileBERT. In contrast, vitals submodules (RNN, GRU, LSTM) and headers require substantially less processing time, underscoring the inefficiency challenge of repeated text submodule computations highlighted in Insight 1.</p>\n\n",

This disparity implies an opportunity for latency reduction through edge-assisted workload offloading. Offloading YOLO11n from Google Glass to Edge-64X achieves over 100&#215; speedup.

The high mAP on the validate set but low mAP and recall on the test set means fine-tuning YOLO11 with Grounding Dino&#8217;s annotations causes the overfitting during the fine-tuning process.

Directly using PyTorch for multimodal inference on mobile devices and edge servers linearly increases cumulative inference time costs. In contrast, our EMSServe demonstrates much better scalability, incurring minimal cumulative inference time increments in all episodes. This is because the conventional multimodal serving framework repeats text module computation across a whole episode. With the modality-aware splitter splitting the text module and other modal modules apart, EMSServe can cache the text features after processing early arrived symptom speech, and reuse the text feature cache with lately arrived data for subsequent multimodal inference. This avoids repeated text feature cache computations in EMS scenarios where different data arrives asynchronously, achieving 1.9&#215; &#8211; 11.7&#215; speedup on all hardware platforms. In real-world deployments where the length of an episode is longer (e.g., unlimited images in video streaming), EMSServe&#8217;s advantage will be more prominent.</p>\n\n",

We put the Google Glass at static distances (0-30 meters) to the Edge-4C in a building.

As we increase the distances, offloading the symptom speech or vitals produces similar cumulative inference latencies while offloading the 10 images tells the essence of offloading in EMS scenarios: it&#8217;s more advantageous to offload images to Edge-4C when the distances are long(e.g., &#191;5m). This is mainly because the size of images used in the episode is relatively large, making offloading images sensitive to the glass-edge distances.</p>\n\n",

Following up with scenario #2 discussed above, a user wearing Google Glass walks from 0m to 30m and then walks back from 30m to 0m, evaluating the adaptive offloading enabled by the latency monitor thread in EMSServe. This is important because, as discussed in Section&#160;<a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2511.13078v1#S1\" title=\"1.

Both figures illustrate that decisions on offloading vitals are not sensitive to mobility due to the fast vitals inference on Google Glass. In (b), with automatic on-glass inference enabled by our adaptive offloading design, where image8 distinguishes the adaptive and nonadaptive offloading options, where the adaptive offloading provides lower model serving latency. In (c), the speech arrives at 30m. While the EMT walks towards Edge-4C, the vitals and images arrive in sequence. When the distance is relatively long (image1-image4), the offloading options achieve comparable cumulative serving latency to on-glass options. When the wireless network becomes unstable (image5), the advantage of adaptively choosing on-glass serving becomes prominent, leaving an obvious gap between non-adaptive and adaptive serving.</p>\n\n",

Directly using PyTorch for multimodal inference on mobile devices and edge servers linearly increases cumulative inference time costs. In contrast, our EMSServe demonstrates much better scalability, incurring minimal cumulative inference time increments in all episodes. This is because the conventional multimodal serving framework repeats text module computation across a whole episode. With the modality-aware splitter splitting the text module and other modal modules apart, EMSServe can cache the text features after processing early arrived symptom speech, and reuse the text feature cache with lately arrived data for subsequent multimodal inference. This avoids repeated text feature cache computations in EMS scenarios where different data arrives asynchronously, achieving 1.9&#215; &#8211; 11.7&#215; speedup on all hardware platforms. In real-world deployments where the length of an episode is longer (e.g., unlimited images in video streaming), EMSServe&#8217;s advantage will be more prominent.</p>\n\n"

Introduction &#8227; A Smart-Glasses for Emergency Medical Services via Multimodal Multitask Learning\"><span class=\"ltx_text ltx_ref_tag\">1</span></a> illustrates the workflow of an EMT in a typical EMS scenario. The EMT first assesses the patient&#8217;s symptoms, then uses medical equipment to obtain vital signs, and finally evaluates the surrounding environment. These multimodal data&#8211;symptoms, vitals, and images in the scene contexts including alcohol and pills&#8211;are asynchronously collected and processed in sequence to inform real-time clinical decision-making. As these multimodal data arrived (i.e., perceived by EMTs) at different timestamps, one of the critical tasks for EMTs is to select the appropriate EMS protocol from over 100 available options, which requires matching the asynchronously observed multimodal data with that defined in each protocol. For example, in Figure&#160;<a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2511.13078v1#acmlabel1\" title=\"Figure 1 &#8227; 1.

Making such high-stakes clinical decisions under time constraints is critical for optimal EMS delivery but remains a significant challenge for EMTs.</p>\n\n",

The Med-Math module then takes the quantity from header 3, using concentration to determine Task 4) dosage prescription. Medicine names undergo a dictionary check to infer Task 5) patient&#8217;s disease history. Both OCR and barcode scanner are needed because we find medicine labels may not always contain both names and barcodes. Complementing the outputs from both pipelines ensures EMSGlass can always extract the desired information.

There are two rounds of annotations: in the first round, we feed unlabeled EMS scene images D4(image) to GD to get bounding box labels. In the second round, instead of annotating from scratch, we adjust GD&#8217;s annotations from the first round (e.g., relabel GD&#8217;s incorrect annotations). After two rounds, we fine-tune the close-set YOLO11. When compared to conventional manual annotation without GD&#8217;s auto-labeling process, our HITL annotation adjustment saves the annotation time by exploiting the correct annotations from GD and leaves the main manual efforts in GD&#8217;s incorrect or missed annotations. From our experiences, this HITL annotation adjustment method decreases the annotation time by half, e.g., on average, from 10 to 5 minutes for every 100 images.</p>\n\n",

However, without PMI, these smaller models struggle with achieving high accuracy. For example, the TinyBERT-GRU-FC&#8217;s top-1 accuracy is as low as 0.64 while its PMI-enabled version reaches the highest 0.7. Furthermore, given the small 3-modal dataset size in D2, the MobileBERT-GRU-FC generates random numbers in its top-3 protocol recommendation outputs, resulting in zero accuracy for three simultaneous tasks (P-M-Q). In contrast, PMI helps MobileBERT-GRU-FC&#8217;s accuracy reach 0.7, which is the highest for the same metric. This indicates PMI&#8217;s potential in increasing small models&#8217; multimodal capability, especially when the dataset size of different modalities is highly imbalanced (123,803 samples in D1, 3005 in D2). As one of the future works, this potential can be further explored and generalized when smaller multimodal on-device models are needed while the size of data modalities is imbalanced.</p>\n\n",

When the distance is relatively long (image1-image4), the offloading options achieve comparable cumulative serving latency to on-glass options.

Participants were then guided through a demonstration scenario showing how EMSGlass transcribes symptoms, displays real-time vitals, detects scene objects (e.g., pills, alcohol bottles), and recommends corresponding EMS protocols, medicines, and dosages. Following the demonstration, participants performed a full simulation independently, interacting with the app to assess a manikin patient by describing symptoms, observing dynamic updates in vitals and recommendations, and completing the scenario by scanning medication labels. Each participant could repeat dry runs until comfortable with the workflow. This structured process ensured that all participants understood EMSGlass&#8217;s multimodal functionalities before proceeding to the formal evaluation.</p>\n\n",

EMSNet integrates text, vital signs, and scene images to construct a unified real-time understanding of EMS incidents. Trained on real-world multimodal EMS datasets, EMSNet simultaneously supports up to five critical EMS tasks with superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art unimodal baselines. Built on top of PyTorch, EMSServe introduces a modality-aware model splitter and a feature caching mechanism, achieving adaptive and efficient inference across heterogeneous hardware while addressing the challenge of asynchronous modality arrival in the field. By optimizing multimodal inference execution in EMS scenarios, EMSServe achieves <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold\">1.9&#215; &#8211; 11.7&#215;</span> speedup over direct PyTorch multimodal inference.\nA user study evaluation with six professional EMTs demonstrates that EMSGlass enhances real-time situational awareness, decision-making speed, and operational efficiency through intuitive on-glass interaction. In addition, qualitative insights from the user study provide actionable directions for extending EMSGlass toward next-generation AI-enabled EMS systems, bridging multimodal intelligence with real-world emergency response workflows.</p>\n\n",

Introduction &#8227; A Smart-Glasses for Emergency Medical Services via Multimodal Multitask Learning\"><span class=\"ltx_text ltx_ref_tag\">1</span></a> illustrates the workflow of an EMT in a typical EMS scenario. The EMT first assesses the patient&#8217;s symptoms, then uses medical equipment to obtain vital signs, and finally evaluates the surrounding environment. These multimodal data&#8211;symptoms, vitals, and images in the scene contexts including alcohol and pills&#8211;are asynchronously collected and processed in sequence to inform real-time clinical decision-making. As these multimodal data arrived (i.e., perceived by EMTs) at different timestamps, one of the critical tasks for EMTs is to select the appropriate EMS protocol from over 100 available options, which requires matching the asynchronously observed multimodal data with that defined in each protocol. For example, in Figure&#160;<a class=\"ltx_ref\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2511.13078v1#acmlabel1\" title=\"Figure 1 &#8227; 1. Introduction &#8227; A Smart-Glasses for Emergency Medical Services via Multimodal Multitask Learning\"><span class=\"ltx_text ltx_ref_tag\">1</span></a>, after analyzing the asynchronously perceived multimodal data, the EMT selects the protocol &#8220;Medical-Respiratory,&#8221; which prescribes general clinical interventions including the administration of Atrovent medicine at a quantity of 0.5mg.

The Med-Math module then takes the quantity from header 3, using concentration to determine Task 4) dosage prescription. Medicine names undergo a dictionary check to infer Task 5) patient&#8217;s disease history. Both OCR and barcode scanner are needed because we find medicine labels may not always contain both names and barcodes. Complementing the outputs from both pipelines ensures EMSGlass can always extract the desired information.

We ultimately choose concatenation due to its higher accuracy on the multimodal EMS dataset. Headers 1 and 2 are standard one-layer classification headers while header 3 is a standard regression header. For simplicity, in this paper, we call the collection of the feature concatenator and three headers as headers.</p>\n\n",

In the second round, instead of annotating from scratch, we adjust GD&#8217;s annotations from the first round (e.g., relabel GD&#8217;s incorrect annotations). After two rounds, we fine-tune the close-set YOLO11. When compared to conventional manual annotation without GD&#8217;s auto-labeling process, our HITL annotation adjustment saves the annotation time by exploiting the correct annotations from GD and leaves the main manual efforts in GD&#8217;s incorrect or missed annotations.

EMSServe design &#8227; A Smart-Glasses for Emergency Medical Services via Multimodal Multitask Learning\"><span class=\"ltx_text ltx_ref_tag\">8</span></a> shows that inference latency differs significantly across hardware. Google Glass, with limited computing power, presents the highest latency, while Edge-64X, with ample resources, is the fastest. For instance, YOLO11n inference takes 3.2s on Google Glass, 0.7s on PH1, 0.08s on Edge-4C, and just 0.03s on Edge-64X. This disparity implies an opportunity for latency reduction through edge-assisted workload offloading. Offloading YOLO11n from Google Glass to Edge-64X achieves over 100&#215; speedup. EMSServe exploits this by offloading high-latency tasks, such as text module inference and object detection, to edge servers.</p>\n\n",

For example, fine-tuning with PMI enables TinyBERT-LSTM-FC to achieve the MSE of 1.89 on the single Q task, close to the lowest MSE of 1.87.

For example, the TinyBERT-GRU-FC&#8217;s top-1 accuracy is as low as 0.64 while its PMI-enabled version reaches the highest 0.7. Furthermore, given the small 3-modal dataset size in D2, the MobileBERT-GRU-FC generates random numbers in its top-3 protocol recommendation outputs, resulting in zero accuracy for three simultaneous tasks (P-M-Q). In contrast, PMI helps MobileBERT-GRU-FC&#8217;s accuracy reach 0.7, which is the highest for the same metric.

In contrast, the mAP of all YOLO11 models on images annotated with Grounding Dino is below 0.6, which is unacceptable. The high mAP on the validate set but low mAP and recall on the test set means fine-tuning YOLO11 with Grounding Dino&#8217;s annotations causes the overfitting during the fine-tuning process.

Directly using PyTorch for multimodal inference on mobile devices and edge servers linearly increases cumulative inference time costs. In contrast, our EMSServe demonstrates much better scalability, incurring minimal cumulative inference time increments in all episodes. This is because the conventional multimodal serving framework repeats text module computation across a whole episode. With the modality-aware splitter splitting the text module and other modal modules apart, EMSServe can cache the text features after processing early arrived symptom speech, and reuse the text feature cache with lately arrived data for subsequent multimodal inference. This avoids repeated text feature cache computations in EMS scenarios where different data arrives asynchronously, achieving 1.9&#215; &#8211; 11.7&#215; speedup on all hardware platforms. In real-world deployments where the length of an episode is longer (e.g., unlimited images in video streaming), EMSServe&#8217;s advantage will be more prominent.</p>\n\n",

Participants were then guided through a demonstration scenario showing how EMSGlass transcribes symptoms, displays real-time vitals, detects scene objects (e.g., pills, alcohol bottles), and recommends corresponding EMS protocols, medicines, and dosages. Following the demonstration, participants performed a full simulation independently, interacting with the app to assess a manikin patient by describing symptoms, observing dynamic updates in vitals and recommendations, and completing the scenario by scanning medication labels. Each participant could repeat dry runs until comfortable with the workflow. This structured process ensured that all participants understood EMSGlass&#8217;s multimodal functionalities before proceeding to the formal evaluation.</p>\n\n",
