In this work, we propose <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_smallcaps\">Think-Verbalize-Speak</span>, a framework that decouples reasoning from spoken delivery to preserve the full reasoning capacity of LLMs. Central to our method is <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">verbalizing</span>, an intermediate step that translates thoughts into natural, speech-ready text.

It performs no independent reasoning, decision-making, or content generation beyond linguistic reformulation. Consequently, factual inaccuracies, biases, or harmful outputs originate entirely from the reasoning model. The verbalization stage merely translates those outputs into a form more suitable for spoken communication. Thus, the overall risk profile of the system is bounded by that of the underlying reasoning model, and our model introduces no novel vulnerabilities.</p>\n\n",

However, direct application of LLMs in spoken communication often yield suboptimal results due to mismatches between optimal textual and verbal delivery. While existing approaches adapt LLMs to produce speech-friendly outputs, their impact on reasoning performance remains underexplored. In this work, we propose <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_smallcaps\">Think-Verbalize-Speak</span>, a framework that decouples reasoning from spoken delivery to preserve the full reasoning capacity of LLMs. Central to our method is <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">verbalizing</span>, an intermediate step that translates thoughts into natural, speech-ready text. We also introduce <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_smallcaps\">ReVerT</span>, a latency-efficient verbalizer based on incremental and asynchronous summarization. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our method enhances speech naturalness and conciseness with minimal impact on reasoning.

This modular approach allows for the integration of state-of-the-art components at each stage.

Consequently, factual inaccuracies, biases, or harmful outputs originate entirely from the reasoning model.

        "body": "Sample text responses for various methods on GSM8K\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\nEach class in a school has 20 students. There are 3 classes. The school as a whole is 50% boys and 50% girls. The first class has 15 girls. The second class has 12 girls. How many boys are in the third class?\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\nChain-of-Thought\n\n\nTo determine the number of boys in the third class, we need to follow these steps:\n1. Calculate the total number of students in the school:\n- Each class has 20 students.\n- There are 3 classes.\n\n\n\nTotal number of students=20×3=60\\text{Total number of students}=20\\times 3=60\n\n\n2. Determine the number of boys and girls in the school:\n- The school is 50% boys and 50% girls.\n\n\n\nNumber of boys=50100×60=30\\text{Number of boys}=\\frac{50}{100}\\times 60=30\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of girls=50100×60=30\\text{Number of girls}=\\frac{50}{100}\\times 60=30\n\n\n3. Find the number of girls in the first and second classes:\n- The first class has 15 girls.\n- The second class has 12 girls.\n4. Calculate the total number of girls in the first two classes:\n\n\n\nTotal number of girls in first and second classes=15+12=27\\text{Total number of girls in first and second classes}=15+12=27\n\n\n5. Determine the number of girls in the third class:\n- Total number of girls in the school is 30.\n\n\n\nNumber of girls in the third class=30−27=3\\text{Number of girls in the third class}=30-27=3\n\n\n6. Calculate the number of boys in the third class:\n- Each class has 20 students.\n- The third class has 3 girls.\n\n\n\nNumber of boys in the third class=20−3=17\\text{Number of boys in the third class}=20-3=17\n\n\nThus, the number of boys in the third class is 17\\boxed{{\\color[rgb]{0,0,0}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0,0,0}\\textbf{17}}}.\n\n\n\n\nSpeech-Friendly Prompting\n\n\nIn each class, there are 20 students. Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, each class also has 10 boys and 10 girls. The first class has 15 girls, which means it has 5 boys (since it’s supposed to have 10 girls, but there are 15, so 20 - 15 = 5 boys). The second class has 12 girls, which means it has 8 boys (since it’s supposed to have 10 girls, but there are 12, so 20 - 12 = 8 boys). So far, we have:\n- First class: 5 boys  - Second class: 8 boys\nThat’s a total of 13 boys in the first two classes. Since each class is supposed to have 10 boys, the third class must have 7 boys (because 10 - 3 = 7, where 3 is the number of boys already counted in the first two classes). So, there are 7 boys in the third class.\n\n\n\n\nSpeech-Friendly Finetuning\n\n\nThe first class has 15 girls, so it has 5 boys. The second class has 12 girls, which means it has 8 boys. Together, these two classes have 23 boys. Since each class has 20 students, there are 60 boys in total. That means the third class must have 37 boys.\n\n\n\n\nTVS (Seq)\n\n\nThe school has 30 boys and 30 girls. The first class has 15 girls. The second class has 12 girls. Together, they have 27 girls. That means the third class has 3 girls. Since each class has 20 students, the third class has 17 boys. So, there are 17 boys in the third class.\n\n\n\n\nTVS (ReVerT)\n\n\nThere are 60 students in total. The school is half boys and half girls. That means there are 30 boys. The first class has 15 girls. The second class has 12 girls. Together, they have 27 girls. If we take 27 away from 30, we get 3 girls in the third class. Since each class has 20 students, the third class has 17 boys.",

In this work, we propose <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_smallcaps\">Think-Verbalize-Speak</span>, a framework that decouples reasoning from spoken delivery to preserve the full reasoning capacity of LLMs. Central to our method is <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">verbalizing</span>, an intermediate step that translates thoughts into natural, speech-ready text.

Evaluate P​(X>Y)=P(X>Y)= P​(X−Y>0)P(X-Y>0).\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n0.4207\n\n\n\n\nChain-of-Thought\n\n\nTo evaluate P​(X>Y)P(X>Y), we need to find the probability that X−Y>0X-Y>0. Given that XX and YY are independent normal random variables, we can determine the distribution of X−YX-Y.\n### Step 1: Determine the Distribution of X−YX-Y\nSince X∼N​(5,16)X\\sim N(5,16) and Y∼N​(6,9)Y\\sim N(6,9):\n- The mean of XX is μX=5\\mu_{X}=5.\n- The variance of XX is σX2=16\\sigma_{X}^{2}=16, so the standard deviation is σX=4\\sigma_{X}=4.\n- The mean of YY is μY=6\\mu_{Y}=6.\n- The variance of YY is σY2=9\\sigma_{Y}^{2}=9, so the standard deviation is σY=3\\sigma_{Y}=3.\nFor the difference X−YX-Y:\n- The mean of X−YX-Y is:\n\n\n\n\nμX−Y=μX−μY=5−6=−1\\newline\n\\mu_{X-Y}=\\mu_{X}-\\mu_{Y}=5-6=-1\\newline\n\n\n\n\n- The variance of X−YX-Y is:\n\n\n\n\nσX−Y2=σX2+σY2=16+9=25\\newline\n\\sigma_{X-Y}^{2}=\\sigma_{X}^{2}+\\sigma_{Y}^{2}=16+9=25\\newline\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, the standard deviation of X−YX-Y is:\n\n\n\n\nσX−Y=25=5\\newline\n\\sigma_{X-Y}=\\sqrt{25}=5\\newline\n\n\n\n\nThus, X−Y∼N​(−1,25)X-Y\\sim N(-1,25).\n### Step 2: Standardize X−YX-Y\nWe need to find P​(X−Y>0)P(X-Y>0). To do this, we standardize X−YX-Y:\n\n\n\n\nZ=(X−Y)−μX−YσX−Y=(X−Y)−(−1)5=X−Y+15\\newline\nZ=\\frac{(X-Y)-\\mu_{X-Y}}{\\sigma_{X-Y}}=\\frac{(X-Y)-(-1)}{5}=\\frac{X-Y+1}{5}\\newline\n\n\n\n\nWe want to find:\n\n\n\n\nP​(X−Y>0)=P​(X−Y+15>0+15)=P​(Z>15)\\newline\nP(X-Y>0)=P\\left(\\frac{X-Y+1}{5}>\\frac{0+1}{5}\\right)=P\\left(Z>\\frac{1}{5}\\right)\\newline\n\n\n\n\n### Step 3: Use the Standard Normal Distribution\nThe variable ZZ follows a standard normal distribution N​(0,1)N(0,1). We need to find P​(Z>0.2)P(Z>0.2).\nUsing standard normal distribution tables or a calculator, we find:\n\n\n\n\nP​(Z>0.2)=1−P​(Z≤0.2)\\newline\nP(Z>0.2)=1-P(Z\\leq 0.2)\\newline\n\n\n\n\nFrom standard normal tables, P​(Z≤0.2)≈0.5793P(Z\\leq 0.2)\\approx 0.5793.\nTherefore:\n\n\n\n\nP​(Z>0.2)=1−0.5793=0.4207\\newline\nP(Z>0.2)=1-0.5793=0.4207\\newline\n\n\n\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\n\n\nP​(X>Y)=P​(X−Y>0)=0.4207\\newline\nP(X>Y)=P(X-Y>0)=\\boxed{{\\color[rgb]{0,0,0}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0,0,0}\\textbf{0.4207}}}\\newline",

However, direct application of LLMs in spoken communication often yield suboptimal results due to mismatches between optimal textual and verbal delivery. While existing approaches adapt LLMs to produce speech-friendly outputs, their impact on reasoning performance remains underexplored. In this work, we propose <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_smallcaps\">Think-Verbalize-Speak</span>, a framework that decouples reasoning from spoken delivery to preserve the full reasoning capacity of LLMs. Central to our method is <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">verbalizing</span>, an intermediate step that translates thoughts into natural, speech-ready text. We also introduce <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_smallcaps\">ReVerT</span>, a latency-efficient verbalizer based on incremental and asynchronous summarization. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our method enhances speech naturalness and conciseness with minimal impact on reasoning.

        "body": "Sample text responses for various methods on SciBench (2)\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\nLet XX and YY be independent with distributions N​(5,16)N(5,16) and N​(6,9)N(6,9), respectively. Evaluate P​(X>Y)=P(X>Y)= P​(X−Y>0)P(X-Y>0).\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n0.4207\n\n\n\n\nSpeech-Friendly Prompting\n\n\nTo find P​(X>Y)P(X>Y), we need to look at the distribution of X−YX-Y. Since XX and YY are independent, the difference X−YX-Y will also follow a normal distribution.\nFirst, let’s determine the mean and variance of X−YX-Y:\n- The mean of XX is 5, and the mean of YY is 6. So, the mean of X−YX-Y is:\n\n\n\n\nμX−Y=μX−μY=5−6=−1\\newline\n\\mu_{X-Y}=\\mu_{X}-\\mu_{Y}=5-6=-1\\newline\n\n\n\n\n- The variance of XX is 16, and the variance of YY is 9. Since XX and YY are independent, the variance of X−YX-Y is:\n\n\n\n\nσX−Y2=σX2+σY2=16+9=25\\newline\n\\sigma^{2}_{X-Y}=\\sigma^{2}_{X}+\\sigma^{2}_{Y}=16+9=25\\newline\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, the standard deviation of X−YX-Y is:\n\n\n\n\nσX−Y=25=5\\newline\n\\sigma_{X-Y}=\\sqrt{25}=5\\newline\n\n\n\n\nSo, X−YX-Y follows a normal distribution N​(−1,25)N(-1,25).\nNow, we want to find P​(X−Y>0)P(X-Y>0). This is equivalent to finding the probability that a normally distributed random variable with mean −1-1 and standard deviation 55 is greater than 0.\nWe can standardize this by converting it to a standard normal distribution:\n\n\n\n\nZ=(X−Y)−(−1)5=X−Y+15\\newline\nZ=\\frac{(X-Y)-(-1)}{5}=\\frac{X-Y+1}{5}\\newline\n\n\n\n\nWe need to find P​(Z>0+15)=P​(Z>0.2)P(Z>\\frac{0+1}{5})=P(Z>0.2).\nUsing standard normal tables or a calculator, we find that:\n\n\n\n\nP​(Z>0.2)≈0.4207\\newline\nP(Z>0.2)\\approx 0.4207\\newline\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, P​(X>Y)=P​(X−Y>0)≈0.4207P(X>Y)=P(X-Y>0)\\approx{\\color[rgb]{0,0,0}\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0,0,0}\\textbf{0.4207}}.\n\n\n\n\nSpeech-Friendly Finetuning\n\n\nThe difference between X and Y, X minus Y, follows a normal distribution. Its mean is 5 minus 6, which is negative 1. Its variance is the sum of the variances of X and Y, so it’s 25. To find P(X greater than Y), we look at P(X minus Y greater than 0). This is the same as finding the probability that a standard normal variable is greater than 1 divided by 5. That value is about 0.3085. So, P(X greater than Y) is approximately 0.3085.\n\n\n\n\nTVS (Seq)\n\n\nThe difference between X and Y is X minus Y. The mean of X minus Y is negative one. The variance is 25, so the standard deviation is five. To find P(X minus Y > 0), we standardize X minus Y. This gives us Z equals (X minus Y plus one) divided by five. We want to find P(Z > 0.2). Since Z is a standard normal variable, we use the standard normal distribution. From the table, P(Z > 0.2) is about 0.4207. So, P(X > Y) is 0.4207.\n\n\n\n\nTVS (ReVerT)\n\n\nThe mean of X minus Y is 5 minus 6, which is -1. The variance is the sum of the variances, 16 plus 9, which equals 25. The standard deviation is the square root of 25, which is 5. To find P(X minus Y is greater than 0), we standardize X minus Y. This gives us a standard normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 5. We want to find the probability that this standard normal is greater than 0.2. Using the standard normal distribution, we find that P(X minus Y is greater than 0) is about 0.42.",

However, direct application of LLMs in spoken communication often yield suboptimal results due to mismatches between optimal textual and verbal delivery. While existing approaches adapt LLMs to produce speech-friendly outputs, their impact on reasoning performance remains underexplored. In this work, we propose <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_smallcaps\">Think-Verbalize-Speak</span>, a framework that decouples reasoning from spoken delivery to preserve the full reasoning capacity of LLMs. Central to our method is <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\">verbalizing</span>, an intermediate step that translates thoughts into natural, speech-ready text. We also introduce <span class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_smallcaps\">ReVerT</span>, a latency-efficient verbalizer based on incremental and asynchronous summarization. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our method enhances speech naturalness and conciseness with minimal impact on reasoning.
