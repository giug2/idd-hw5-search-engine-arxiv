Tonal characteristics refers to the pitch variation patterns of a syllable during pronunciation. This supplementation is based on the fact that Mandarin is a tonal language. For non-tonal languages like English, other semantic features can be used during processing.

This paper proposes FabasedVC to achieve VC with enhanced similarity in timbre, prosody, and duration to the target speaker, as well as improved content integrity. It is an end-to-end VITS-based VC system that integrates relevant textual modality information, phoneme-level self-supervised learning (SSL) features, and a duration predictor. Specifically, we employ a text feature encoder to encode attributes such as text, phonemes, tones and BERT features. We then process the frame-level SSL features into phoneme-level features using two methods: average pooling and attention mechanism based on each phoneme&#8217;s duration. Moreover, a duration predictor is incorporated to better align the speech rate and prosody of the target speaker. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms competing systems in terms of naturalness, similarity, and content integrity.

On this basis, the two types of information can be integrated, thereby achieving the effect of voice conversion. However, several challenges remain in the field. Firstly, the speaker-independent features extracted are entirely derived from the source speech, which means that their duration and prosody closely follow those of the source. However, each speaker possesses a unique speaking style. Following the prosody, pauses, and duration of the source speech strictly when generating converted speech does not adequately reflect the relevant characteristics of the target speaker. This can reduce the perceived similarity to the target speaker among listeners. Secondly, existing voice conversion systems encounter challenges in preserving the integrity of the content in the generated speech. This in turn affects the semantic accuracy and naturalness of the generated speech. Lastly, current disentanglement methods are inadequate in effectively removing timbre information, resulting in issues of timbre leakage during voice conversion tasks.</p>\n\n",

Specifically, this system enhances existing VC frameworks by introducing supplementary textual modality information, processing features at the phoneme level, and integrating a duration predictor. Firstly, the system employs ASR and related annotation tools to add various character and phoneme-level textual modality annotations to the existing VC system, thereby improving content completeness. Secondly, We utilize a Forced Aligner tool to obtain phoneme-level timestamps, which we then utilize to convert the disentangled SSL features from the frame level to the phoneme level. This conversion is achieved through phoneme-level average pooling and attention mechanisms. Compared to frame-level features, phoneme-level features provide the advantage of modifiable duration and significantly enhance the disentanglement of speaker timbre information. Lastly, We incorporate a duration predictor into the model which allows the duration of each phoneme to be re-predicted during inference. The re-prediction uses the encoded phoneme-level features combined with the target speaker&#8217;s information. When the re-prediction disabled, VC matches the source speech duration; when enabled, it adjusts the duration to improve similarity. Experimental results demonstrate that FabasedVC effectively preserves the content information from the source speech while achieving a high degree of similarity in timbre, duration, and prosody with the target speaker.

VQMIVC achieves effective VC by disentangling speech representations; PPGVC is a VC system based on the BNF framework; FreeVC employs the VITS framework to provide high-quality waveform reconstruction for VC; and SOVITS is a well-regarded open-source SVC and VC project. Cosyvoice is a highly effective zero-shot TTS model that significantly enhances content consistency and speaker similarity. It also supports voice conversion capabilities. SeedVC achieves high-fidelity, low-leakage zero-shot voice conversion via external timbre perturbation and a diffusion Transformer. For CosyVoice and SeedVC, we used the official open-source models for voice conversion, and we trained other VC comparison models using the same dataset as FabasedVC. Additionally, we conducted ablation studies on the SSL encoder and duration predictor to verify the effectiveness of each component.</p>\n\n",

For the subjective evaluation, 20 participants rated the naturalness and similarity of the audio using a 5-point Mean Opinion Score (MOS). We randomly selected four target speakers (two males and two females) from the AISHELL3 dataset and evaluated the system under two scenarios: converting the speech of AISHELL speakers to that of target speakers, and converting the speech of a DataBaker speaker to that of target speakers. The DataBaker dataset features standard pronunciation and stable prosody, whereas speakers in the AISHELL3 dataset exhibit various accents and speaking habits. Evaluating under these two scenarios aims to test the robustness of the system and the prosodic diversity generated for different target speakers. This approach better demonstrates the model&#8217;s capabilities in modeling duration and prosody. For the objective evaluation, we adopted three metrics: Character Error Rate (CER), Phoneme Error Rate (PER), and Cosine Similarity (Cos.sim). CER was obtained via an ASR model<span class=\"ltx_note ltx_role_footnote\" id=\"footnote4\"><sup class=\"ltx_note_mark\">4</sup><span class=\"ltx_note_outer\"><span class=\"ltx_note_content\"><sup class=\"ltx_note_mark\">4</sup><span class=\"ltx_tag ltx_tag_note\">4</span>https://github.com/wenet-e2e/wenet</span></span></span> to measure the character error rate between the source speech and the converted speech. Similarly, PER measures the phoneme error rate following ASR. Cos.sim is derived from the speaker embeddings of the converted speech, objectively quantifying the similarity between the converted speech and the target speaker. In this paper, we utilized a commonly employed speaker embedding extraction model from PPGVC<span class=\"ltx_note ltx_role_footnote\" id=\"footnote5\"><sup class=\"ltx_note_mark\">5</sup><span class=\"ltx_note_outer\"><span class=\"ltx_note_content\"><sup class=\"ltx_note_mark\">5</sup><span class=\"ltx_tag ltx_tag_note\">5</span>https://github.com/liusongxiang/ppg-vc/blob/main/speaker_encoder/ckpt</span></span></span> to obtain the speaker embeddings used for testing.

Experiments &#8227; FabasedVC: Enhancing Voice Conversion with Text Modality Fusion and Phoneme-Level SSL Features\"><span class=\"ltx_text ltx_ref_tag\">2</span></a> indicate that our model achieves the highest scores on the majority of metrics for both speech naturalness and speaker similarity, surpassing all baseline models, with the exception of a single metric where it ranks second. Even when converting Databaker data to AISHELL speakers, our model maintains a high level of similarity. Despite the significant differences in style and Mandarin proficiency between the source and target speakers, the model achieves it. This clearly demonstrates the role of phoneme-level SSL features and the duration predictor in enhancing speaker similarity. The higher Cos.sim scores further confirm that our model maintains high speaker similarity. Additionally, more comprehensive feature information can facilitate the model in generating speech with higher naturalness. Our proposed model achieves lower CER and PER compared to all other models. This also demonstrates the effectiveness of FabasedVC in addressing the loss of content completeness and better preserving the linguistic content of the source speech.

Even when converting Databaker data to AISHELL speakers, our model maintains a high level of similarity. Despite the significant differences in style and Mandarin proficiency between the source and target speakers, the model achieves it. This clearly demonstrates the role of phoneme-level SSL features and the duration predictor in enhancing speaker similarity. The higher Cos.sim scores further confirm that our model maintains high speaker similarity. Additionally, more comprehensive feature information can facilitate the model in generating speech with higher naturalness. Our proposed model achieves lower CER and PER compared to all other models. This also demonstrates the effectiveness of FabasedVC in addressing the loss of content completeness and better preserving the linguistic content of the source speech.

It is an end-to-end VITS-based VC system that integrates relevant textual modality information, phoneme-level self-supervised learning (SSL) features, and a duration predictor. Specifically, we employ a text feature encoder to encode attributes such as text, phonemes, tones and BERT features. We then process the frame-level SSL features into phoneme-level features using two methods: average pooling and attention mechanism based on each phoneme&#8217;s duration. Moreover, a duration predictor is incorporated to better align the speech rate and prosody of the target speaker. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms competing systems in terms of naturalness, similarity, and content integrity.

On this basis, the two types of information can be integrated, thereby achieving the effect of voice conversion. However, several challenges remain in the field. Firstly, the speaker-independent features extracted are entirely derived from the source speech, which means that their duration and prosody closely follow those of the source. However, each speaker possesses a unique speaking style. Following the prosody, pauses, and duration of the source speech strictly when generating converted speech does not adequately reflect the relevant characteristics of the target speaker. This can reduce the perceived similarity to the target speaker among listeners. Secondly, existing voice conversion systems encounter challenges in preserving the integrity of the content in the generated speech. This in turn affects the semantic accuracy and naturalness of the generated speech. Lastly, current disentanglement methods are inadequate in effectively removing timbre information, resulting in issues of timbre leakage during voice conversion tasks.</p>\n\n",

Specifically, this system enhances existing VC frameworks by introducing supplementary textual modality information, processing features at the phoneme level, and integrating a duration predictor. Firstly, the system employs ASR and related annotation tools to add various character and phoneme-level textual modality annotations to the existing VC system, thereby improving content completeness. Secondly, We utilize a Forced Aligner tool to obtain phoneme-level timestamps, which we then utilize to convert the disentangled SSL features from the frame level to the phoneme level. This conversion is achieved through phoneme-level average pooling and attention mechanisms. Compared to frame-level features, phoneme-level features provide the advantage of modifiable duration and significantly enhance the disentanglement of speaker timbre information. Lastly, We incorporate a duration predictor into the model which allows the duration of each phoneme to be re-predicted during inference. The re-prediction uses the encoded phoneme-level features combined with the target speaker&#8217;s information. When the re-prediction disabled, VC matches the source speech duration; when enabled, it adjusts the duration to improve similarity. Experimental results demonstrate that FabasedVC effectively preserves the content information from the source speech while achieving a high degree of similarity in timbre, duration, and prosody with the target speaker.

For the subjective evaluation, 20 participants rated the naturalness and similarity of the audio using a 5-point Mean Opinion Score (MOS). We randomly selected four target speakers (two males and two females) from the AISHELL3 dataset and evaluated the system under two scenarios: converting the speech of AISHELL speakers to that of target speakers, and converting the speech of a DataBaker speaker to that of target speakers. The DataBaker dataset features standard pronunciation and stable prosody, whereas speakers in the AISHELL3 dataset exhibit various accents and speaking habits. Evaluating under these two scenarios aims to test the robustness of the system and the prosodic diversity generated for different target speakers. This approach better demonstrates the model&#8217;s capabilities in modeling duration and prosody. For the objective evaluation, we adopted three metrics: Character Error Rate (CER), Phoneme Error Rate (PER), and Cosine Similarity (Cos.sim). CER was obtained via an ASR model<span class=\"ltx_note ltx_role_footnote\" id=\"footnote4\"><sup class=\"ltx_note_mark\">4</sup><span class=\"ltx_note_outer\"><span class=\"ltx_note_content\"><sup class=\"ltx_note_mark\">4</sup><span class=\"ltx_tag ltx_tag_note\">4</span>https://github.com/wenet-e2e/wenet</span></span></span> to measure the character error rate between the source speech and the converted speech. Similarly, PER measures the phoneme error rate following ASR. Cos.sim is derived from the speaker embeddings of the converted speech, objectively quantifying the similarity between the converted speech and the target speaker.

This paper proposes FabasedVC to achieve VC with enhanced similarity in timbre, prosody, and duration to the target speaker, as well as improved content integrity. It is an end-to-end VITS-based VC system that integrates relevant textual modality information, phoneme-level self-supervised learning (SSL) features, and a duration predictor. Specifically, we employ a text feature encoder to encode attributes such as text, phonemes, tones and BERT features. We then process the frame-level SSL features into phoneme-level features using two methods: average pooling and attention mechanism based on each phoneme&#8217;s duration. Moreover, a duration predictor is incorporated to better align the speech rate and prosody of the target speaker. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms competing systems in terms of naturalness, similarity, and content integrity.

On this basis, the two types of information can be integrated, thereby achieving the effect of voice conversion. However, several challenges remain in the field. Firstly, the speaker-independent features extracted are entirely derived from the source speech, which means that their duration and prosody closely follow those of the source. However, each speaker possesses a unique speaking style. Following the prosody, pauses, and duration of the source speech strictly when generating converted speech does not adequately reflect the relevant characteristics of the target speaker. This can reduce the perceived similarity to the target speaker among listeners. Secondly, existing voice conversion systems encounter challenges in preserving the integrity of the content in the generated speech. This in turn affects the semantic accuracy and naturalness of the generated speech. Lastly, current disentanglement methods are inadequate in effectively removing timbre information, resulting in issues of timbre leakage during voice conversion tasks.</p>\n\n",

Specifically, this system enhances existing VC frameworks by introducing supplementary textual modality information, processing features at the phoneme level, and integrating a duration predictor. Firstly, the system employs ASR and related annotation tools to add various character and phoneme-level textual modality annotations to the existing VC system, thereby improving content completeness. Secondly, We utilize a Forced Aligner tool to obtain phoneme-level timestamps, which we then utilize to convert the disentangled SSL features from the frame level to the phoneme level. This conversion is achieved through phoneme-level average pooling and attention mechanisms. Compared to frame-level features, phoneme-level features provide the advantage of modifiable duration and significantly enhance the disentanglement of speaker timbre information. Lastly, We incorporate a duration predictor into the model which allows the duration of each phoneme to be re-predicted during inference. The re-prediction uses the encoded phoneme-level features combined with the target speaker&#8217;s information. When the re-prediction disabled, VC matches the source speech duration; when enabled, it adjusts the duration to improve similarity. Experimental results demonstrate that FabasedVC effectively preserves the content information from the source speech while achieving a high degree of similarity in timbre, duration, and prosody with the target speaker.

VQMIVC achieves effective VC by disentangling speech representations; PPGVC is a VC system based on the BNF framework; FreeVC employs the VITS framework to provide high-quality waveform reconstruction for VC; and SOVITS is a well-regarded open-source SVC and VC project. Cosyvoice is a highly effective zero-shot TTS model that significantly enhances content consistency and speaker similarity. It also supports voice conversion capabilities. SeedVC achieves high-fidelity, low-leakage zero-shot voice conversion via external timbre perturbation and a diffusion Transformer. For CosyVoice and SeedVC, we used the official open-source models for voice conversion, and we trained other VC comparison models using the same dataset as FabasedVC. Additionally, we conducted ablation studies on the SSL encoder and duration predictor to verify the effectiveness of each component.</p>\n\n",

For the subjective evaluation, 20 participants rated the naturalness and similarity of the audio using a 5-point Mean Opinion Score (MOS). We randomly selected four target speakers (two males and two females) from the AISHELL3 dataset and evaluated the system under two scenarios: converting the speech of AISHELL speakers to that of target speakers, and converting the speech of a DataBaker speaker to that of target speakers. The DataBaker dataset features standard pronunciation and stable prosody, whereas speakers in the AISHELL3 dataset exhibit various accents and speaking habits. Evaluating under these two scenarios aims to test the robustness of the system and the prosodic diversity generated for different target speakers. This approach better demonstrates the model&#8217;s capabilities in modeling duration and prosody. For the objective evaluation, we adopted three metrics: Character Error Rate (CER), Phoneme Error Rate (PER), and Cosine Similarity (Cos.sim). CER was obtained via an ASR model<span class=\"ltx_note ltx_role_footnote\" id=\"footnote4\"><sup class=\"ltx_note_mark\">4</sup><span class=\"ltx_note_outer\"><span class=\"ltx_note_content\"><sup class=\"ltx_note_mark\">4</sup><span class=\"ltx_tag ltx_tag_note\">4</span>https://github.com/wenet-e2e/wenet</span></span></span> to measure the character error rate between the source speech and the converted speech. Similarly, PER measures the phoneme error rate following ASR. Cos.sim is derived from the speaker embeddings of the converted speech, objectively quantifying the similarity between the converted speech and the target speaker. In this paper, we utilized a commonly employed speaker embedding extraction model from PPGVC<span class=\"ltx_note ltx_role_footnote\" id=\"footnote5\"><sup class=\"ltx_note_mark\">5</sup><span class=\"ltx_note_outer\"><span class=\"ltx_note_content\"><sup class=\"ltx_note_mark\">5</sup><span class=\"ltx_tag ltx_tag_note\">5</span>https://github.com/liusongxiang/ppg-vc/blob/main/speaker_encoder/ckpt</span></span></span> to obtain the speaker embeddings used for testing.

Experiments &#8227; FabasedVC: Enhancing Voice Conversion with Text Modality Fusion and Phoneme-Level SSL Features\"><span class=\"ltx_text ltx_ref_tag\">2</span></a> indicate that our model achieves the highest scores on the majority of metrics for both speech naturalness and speaker similarity, surpassing all baseline models, with the exception of a single metric where it ranks second. Even when converting Databaker data to AISHELL speakers, our model maintains a high level of similarity. Despite the significant differences in style and Mandarin proficiency between the source and target speakers, the model achieves it. This clearly demonstrates the role of phoneme-level SSL features and the duration predictor in enhancing speaker similarity. The higher Cos.sim scores further confirm that our model maintains high speaker similarity. Additionally, more comprehensive feature information can facilitate the model in generating speech with higher naturalness. Our proposed model achieves lower CER and PER compared to all other models. This also demonstrates the effectiveness of FabasedVC in addressing the loss of content completeness and better preserving the linguistic content of the source speech.
